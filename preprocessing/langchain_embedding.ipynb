              "[Document(page_content='YOUR KINDLE NOTES FOR: High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove 189 Highlights \\n 3 Notes Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 93 We did all this because under this strong attack, we learned that we must lead with our strength. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 137 Middle managers are the muscle and bone of every sizable organization, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 156 anything that can be done will be done, if not by you, then by someone else. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 157 you need to develop a higher tolerance for disorder. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 165 “Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.” Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 170 As a micro CEO, you can improve your own and your group’s performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 184 The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 185 what can managers do to increase the output of their teams? Free Kindle instant preview: https://a.co/9pe6kY8 Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 188 High managerial productivity, I argue, depends largely on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 189 A team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from the individuals in it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 196 Second, a responsive company should have fewer levels of managers. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 246 The key to survival is to learn to add more value—and that ultimately is what this book is about. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 257 the essential skill of entrepreneurship: how to manage. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 290 A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 293 A manager’s skills and knowledge are only valuable if she uses them to get more leverage from her people. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 303 you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 304 tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 381 These are to build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, at an acceptable quality level, and at the lowest possible cost. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 471 equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 499 The point is that whenever possible, you should choose in-process tests over those that destroy product. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 516 A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 571 So because indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting. This you can do by pairing indicators, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 579 The first rule is that a measurement—any measurement—is better than none. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 579 But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity). Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 625 Leading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 626 Of course, for leading indicators to do you any good, you must believe in their validity. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 628 But unless you are prepared to act on what your leading indicators are telling you, all you will get from monitoring them is anxiety. Highlight (Yellow) and Note \\n Location 638 allowing us time to take corrective action. La unica razon d tener indicadores es tomar acciones correctivas Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 732 it is vitally important to reject defective material at a stage where its accumulated value is at the lowest possible level. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 734 In short, reject before investing further value. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 749 one should never let substandard material proceed when its defects could cause a complete failure—a reliability problem—for our customer. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 751 Simply put, because we can never assess the consequences of an unreliable product, we can’t make compromises when it comes to reliability. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 758 minimum disturbance to the production process itself. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 786 this only created more logistical overhead with no effect on output. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 818 leverage, which is the output generated by a specific type of work activity. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 841 And as noted, stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 886 They are absolutely my job—not my entire job, but part of it, because they help add to the output of Intel. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 963 My day always ends when I’m tired and ready to go home, not when I’m done. I am never done. Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 965 A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 980 Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information. Writing the report is important; reading it often is not. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 985 The formal authorization is useful only because it enforces the discipline of the process. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1005 Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate his objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1007 Thus, transmitting objectives and preferred approaches constitutes a key to successful delegation. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1019 your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1022 In short, information-gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1033 Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted easily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effectively by doing and doing visibly. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1042 But the single most important resource that we allocate from one day to the next is our own time. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1045 How you handle your own time is, in my view, the single most important aspect of being a role model and leader. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1065 Clearly the key to high output means being sensitive to the leverage of what you do during the day. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1080 By spending a certain amount of time in advance of the planning activities, Robin will help to eliminate confusion and ambiguity for a large population of managers over an extended period of time. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1086 Thus to maximize the leverage of his activities, a manager must keep timeliness, which is often critical, firmly in mind. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1101 A manager can also exert high leverage by engaging in an activity that takes him only a short time, but that affects another person’s performance over a long time. A performance review represents a good example of this. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1113 the lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1117 This occurs when a supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a subordinate’s responsibilities to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate work things through himself. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1121 the subordinate will begin to take a much more restricted view of what is expected of him, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1122 showing less initiative in solving his own problems Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1133 The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1149 avoid the charade of insincere delegation, which can produce immense negative managerial leverage. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1151 delegation without follow-through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1161 We should apply quality assurance principles and monitor at Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1161 the lowest-added-value stage of the process. For example, review rough drafts of reports that you have delegated; don’t wait until your subordinates have spent time polishing them into final form before you find out that you have a basic problem with the contents. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1168 As the subordinate’s work improves over time, you should respond with a corresponding reduction in the intensity of the monitoring. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1186 what is the “egg” in our work? Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1191 A second production principle we can apply to managerial work is batching similar tasks. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1199 to maximize the use of the mental set-up time needed for the task. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1208 the manager should use his calendar as a “production” planning tool, taking a firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between those “limiting steps” in the day. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1219 It is important to say “no” earlier rather than later because we’ve learned that to wait until something reaches a higher value stage and then abort due to lack of capacity means losing more money and time. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1265 Accordingly, we should do everything we can to prevent little stops and starts in our day as well as interruptions brought on by big emergencies. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1291 By maintaining an archive of information, a manager doesn’t have to do ad hoc research every time the phone rings. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1297 The key is this: understand that interrupters have legitimate problems that need to be handled. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1359 So the latter should be asked to prepare an outline, which is very important because it forces him to think through in advance all of the issues and points he plans to raise. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1366 even if it’s only an intuition that something’s wrong, a subordinate owes it to his supervisor to tell him, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1439 Please note that lecturer is not listed. A supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which is the surest way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting’s basic purpose. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1471 Because the senior supervisor is a role model for the junior managers present, he should take his role at the review extremely seriously. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1505 It is not enough to ask people and hope for the best; you need to follow up and get commitments. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1539 The minutes should also be as clear and as specific as possible, telling the reader what is to be done, who is to do it, and when. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1565 If Intel used people holding old-fashioned position power to make all its decisions, decisions would be made by people unfamiliar with the technology of the day. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1585 The next stage is reaching a clear decision. Again, the greater the disagreement about the issue, the more important becomes the word clear. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1590 Finally, everyone involved must give the decision reached by the group full support. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1590 This does not necessarily mean agreement: Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1594 But an organization does not live by its members agreeing with one another at all times about everything. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1604 that any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1632 Peers tend to look for a more senior manager, even if he is not the most competent or knowledgeable person involved, to take over and shape a meeting. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1645 self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1711 this was a big enough deal that the president of the company should be involved. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1839 But today’s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1841 What do I have to do today to solve—or better, avoid—tomorrow’s problem? Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1845 In other words, the output of the planning process is the decisions made and the actions taken as a result of the process. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1880 that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1897 if the subordinate’s objectives are met, the supervisor’s will be as well. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1912 Note that the objective is relatively short-range and the key results are so specific that a person knows without question whether he has completed them and done it on time or not. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1914 there is no room for ambiguity. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1934 Before long we found, however, that the network required a set of tasks and skills very different from those needed to run our one restaurant. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1974 We now discover that management is not just a team game, it is a game in which we have to fashion a team of teams, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1981 Though most are mixed, organizations can come in two extreme forms: in totally mission-oriented form or in totally functional form. Note \\n Location 1987 Nosotros queremos ser mission oriented pero no lo hemos logrdo Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 1999 “Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2002 Our hybrid nature comes from the fact that the form of the overall corporate organization results from a mix of the business divisions, which are mission-oriented, and the functional groups. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2005 Because each such unit does not have to maintain its own support groups, it can concentrate on a specific mission, like taking a hill in a battle. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2033 What are some of the advantages of organizing much of a company in a mission-oriented form? There is only one. It is that the individual units can stay in touch with the needs of their business or product areas and initiate changes rapidly when those needs change. That is it. All other considerations favor the functional-type of organization. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2054 Here I would like to propose Grove’s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2067 Do any exceptions exist to the universality of hybrid organizations? The only exceptions that come to my mind are conglomerates, which are typically organized in a totally mission-oriented form. Why are they an exception to our rule? Because they do not have a common business purpose. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2116 After we wrestled with the dilemma for a while, it occurred to us that perhaps security personnel should report jointly to the corporate security manager and to the local plant manager. The first would specify how the job ought to be done, and the second would monitor how it was being performed day by day. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2119 Could an employee in fact have two bosses? The answer was a tentative “yes,” and the culture of joint reporting relationships, dual reporting, was born. It was a slow, laborious birth. Note \\n Location 2149 Nuestro caso en el área de diseño Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2234 Our ability to use Cindy’s skill and know-how in two different capacities makes it possible for her to exert a much larger leverage at Intel. In her main job, her knowledge affects the work that takes place in one plant; in her second, through what she does in the process coordinating group, she can influence the work of all plants. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2273 Similarly, our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means. These are: • free-market forces • contractual obligations • cultural values Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2318 As for cultural values, management has to develop and nurture the common set of values, objectives, and methods essential for the existence of trust. How do we do that? One way is by articulation, by spelling out these values, objectives, and methods. The other, even more important, way is by example. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2346 Let’s apply our model to the work of a new employee. What is his motivation? It is very much based on self- interest. So you should give him a clearly structured job with a low CUA factor. If he does well, he will begin to feel more at home, worry less about himself, and start to care more about his team. He learns that if he is on a boat and wants to get ahead, it is better for him to help row than to run to the bow. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2352 Bring young people in at relatively low-level, well-defined jobs with low CUA factors, and over time they will share experiences with their peers, supervisors, and subordinates and will learn the values, objectives, and methods of the organization. They will gradually accept, even flourish in, the complex world of multiple bosses and peer decision-making. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2372 The point is, expectations can be as binding as a legal document. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2386 Belief and faith are not aspects of the market mode, but stem from adherence to cultural values. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2397 When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2402 The single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2407 A manager has two ways to improve performance: training and motivation. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2410 Accordingly, all a manager can do is create an environment in which motivated people can flourish. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2412 What matters is if he performs better or worse because his environment changed. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2424 For Maslow, motivation is closely tied to the idea of needs, which cause people to have drives, which in turn result in motivation. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2455 As one’s environment or condition in life changes, one’s desire to satisfy a particular set of needs is replaced by a desire to satisfy another set. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2477 All of the sources of motivation we’ve talked about so far are self-limiting. That is, when a need is gratified, it can no longer motivate a person. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2503 When the need to stretch is not spontaneous, management needs to create an environment to foster it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2506 Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2507 Moreover, if we want to cultivate achievement-driven motivation, we need to create an environment that values and emphasizes output. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2530 The most important type of measure is feedback on his performance. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2540 The most important form of such task-relevant feedback is the performance review every subordinate should receive from his supervisor. More about this later. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2553 Thus, our role as managers is, first, to train the individuals (to move them along the horizontal axis shown in the because once there, their motivation will be self-sustaining and limitless. illustration on this page), and, second, to bring them to the point where self-actualization motivates them, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2567 Our society respects someone’s throwing himself into sports, but anybody who works very long hours is regarded as sick, a workaholic. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2577 This is key to the manager’s approach and involvement: he has to see the work as it is seen by the people who do that work every day and then create indicators so that his subordinates can watch their “racetrack” take shape. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2584 Comparing our work to sports may also teach us how to cope with failure. As noted, one of the big impediments to a fully committed, highly motivated state of mind is preoccupation with failure. Yet we know that in any competitive sport, at least 50 percent of all matches are lost. All participants know that from the outset, and yet rarely do they give up at any stage of a contest. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2586 The role of the manager here is also clear: it is that of the coach. First, an ideal coach takes no personal credit for the success of his team, and because of that his players trust him. Second, he is tough on his team. By being critical, he tries to get the best performance his team members can provide. Third, a good coach was likely a good player himself at one time. And having played the game well, he also understands it well. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2624 The conclusion is that varying management styles are needed as task-relevant maturity varies. Specifically, when the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2630 But regardless of what the TRM may be, the manager should always monitor a subordinate’s work closely enough to avoid surprises. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2646 TASK-RELEVANT MATURITY OF SUBORDINATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT STYLE low Structured; task-oriented; tell “what,” “when,” “how” medium Individual- oriented; emphasis on two-way communication, support, mutual reasoning high Involvement by manager minimal: establishing objectives and monitoring Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2665 The subordinate did poor work. My associate’s reaction: “He has to make his own mistakes. That’s how he learns!” The problem with this is that the subordinate’s tuition is paid by his customers. And that is absolutely wrong. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2737 The fact is that giving such reviews is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2742 But what is its fundamental purpose? Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2743 it is to improve the subordinate’s performance. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2760 The long and short of it: if performance matters in your operation, performance reviews are absolutely necessary. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2767 Anybody who supervises professionals, therefore, walks a tightrope: he needs to be objective, but must not be afraid of using his judgment, even though judgment is by definition subjective. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2770 The biggest problem with most reviews is that we don’t usually define what it is we want from our subordinates, and, as noted earlier, if we don’t know what we want, we are surely not going to get it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2781 A similar kind of trade-off also has to be considered here: weighing long-term-oriented against short-term- oriented performance. An engineer working on the design of a product needs to complete the project on a strict schedule to generate revenue. He may also be working on a design method that will make it easier for others to design similar products in the future. The engineer obviously needs both activities evaluated and reviewed. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2805 As managers, we are really called upon to judge performance, not just to see and record it when it’s in plain sight. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2811 One big pitfall to be avoided is the “potential trap.” At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2816 the performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization! Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2825 It is hard enough for us to assess our subordinates’ performance, but we must also try to improve it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2829 There are three L’s to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2843 If his responses—verbal and nonverbal—do not completely assure you that what you’ve said has gotten through, it is your responsibility to keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2866 The fact is that a person can only absorb so many messages at one time, especially when they deal with his own performance. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2867 The purpose of the review is not to cleanse your system of all the truths you may have observed about your subordinate, but to improve his performance. So here less may very well be more. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2915 Once responsibility has been assumed, however, finding the solution is relatively easy. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2933 So up to a point you should try to get your subordinate to agree with you. But if you can’t, accept his commitment to change and go on. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2941 If it becomes clear that you are not going to get your subordinate past the blame-others stage, you will have to assume the formal role of the supervisor, endowed with position power, and say, “This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do. I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do…” And proceed to secure your subordinate’s commitment to the course of action you want and thereafter monitor his performance against that commitment. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2967 Put another way, concentrating on the stars is a high-leverage activity: if they get better, the impact on group output is very great indeed. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2969 We must keep in mind, however, that no matter how stellar a person’s performance level is, there is always room for improvement. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2976 Reviewing the performance of subordinates is a formal act of leadership. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 2994 In my experience, the best thing to do is to give your subordinate the written review sometime before the face-to- face discussion. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3001 Each year I read something like a hundred evaluations, all of those written by my own subordinates and a random selection from throughout Intel. I comment on them and send them back for rewrites or with a complimentary note. I do this with as much noise and visibility as I can, because I want to reiterate and reaffirm the significance the system has and should have for every Intel employee. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3104 So in the end careful interviewing doesn’t guarantee you anything, it merely increases your odds of getting lucky. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3111 He then mutters further that he has decided to leave the company. You look at him wide-eyed. Your initial reaction to his announcement is absolutely crucial. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3114 If you do not deal with the situation right at the first mention, you’ll confirm his feelings and the outcome is inevitable. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3115 Drop what you are doing. Sit him down and ask him why he is quitting. Let him talk—don’t argue about anything with him. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3117 Make him talk, because after the prepared points are delivered, the real issues may come out. Don’t argue, don’t lecture, and don’t panic. Remember, this is only the opening skirmish, not the war. And you cannot win the war here—but you can lose it! You have to convey to him by what you do that he is important to you, and you have to find out what is really troubling him. Don’t try to change his mind at this point, but buy time. After he’s said all he has to say, ask for whatever time you feel is necessary to prepare yourself for the next round. But know that you must follow through on whatever you’ve committed yourself to do. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3127 You now must vigorously pursue every avenue available to you to keep him with the firm, even if it means transferring him to another department. If it seems that is the likely solution, you must become the project manager of that solution until the whole thing is settled. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3135 He might go on to say that you’re only doing it now because he forced you into it, his feeling being that “If I stay, you’ll think of me as the blackmailer forever!” Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3137 You now have to make him feel comfortable with the new arrangement. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3155 At higher levels of compensation, an incremental amount of money gradually will have less and less material utility to the person who gets it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3210 If we want to use such schemes, we have to come to terms with the principle—troubling to many managers— that any merit-based system requires a competitive, comparative evaluation of individuals. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3218 Promotions must be based on performance, because that is the only way to keep the idea of performance highlighted, maintained, and perpetuated. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3236 If we take a person at point B and don’t offer him more work and greater challenges even though he “exceeds the requirements” of Job 1, we are not fully utilizing a human resource of the company. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3255 In sum, we managers must be responsible and provide our subordinates with honest performance ratings and honest merit-based compensation. If we do, the eventual result will be performance valued for its own sake throughout our organization. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3280 A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3284 Training is, quite simply, one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3296 For training to be effective, it also has to maintain a reliable, consistent presence. Employees should be able to count on something systematic and scheduled, not a rescue effort summoned to solve the problem of the moment. In other words, training should be a process, not an event. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3310 We train our managers in disciplines such as strategic planning as well as in the art of constructive confrontation, a problem-solving approach we favor at Intel. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3311 My own training repertoire includes a course on preparing and delivering performance reviews, on conducting productive meetings, and a three-hour-long introduction to Intel, Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3315 At Intel we distinguish between two different training tasks. The first task is teaching new members of our organization the skills needed to perform their jobs. The second task is teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to the present members of our organization. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3324 So what should you do if you embrace the gospel of training? For starters, make a list of the things you feel your subordinates or the members of your department should be trained in. Don’t limit the scope of your list. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3327 Ask the people working for you what they feel they need. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3349 Training is hard work. Preparing lectures and getting yourself ready to handle all the questions thrown at you is difficult. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3351 Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3369 Define the proper places for the equivalents of receiving inspection, in-process inspection, and final inspection in your work. Decide whether these inspections should be monitoring steps or gate-like. Identify the conditions under which you can relax things and move to a variable inspection scheme. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3373 Identify half a dozen new indicators for your group’s output. They should measure both the quantity and quality of the output. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3375 Install these new indicators as a routine in your work area, and establish their regular review in your staff meetings. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3381 Conduct work simplification on your most tedious, time-consuming task. Eliminate at least 30 percent of the total number of steps involved. Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3393 Describe how you will monitor the next project you delegate to a subordinate. What will you look for? How? How frequently? Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3395 Generate an inventory of projects on which you can work at discretionary times.

Highlight (Yellow) \\n Location 3414 Give your subordinates a racetrack: define a set of performance indicators for each.

              " Document(page_content=\"What Is a Manager’s Output?\\nIasked a group of middle managers just that question.\\nI got these responses:\\njudgments and opinions\\nallocation of resources\\npersonnel trained and subordinates developed\\nDo these things really constitute the output of a manager? I don’t think so. They are\\ninstead activities, or descriptions of what managers do as they try to create a final result,\\nor output. What, then, is a manager’s output? At Intel, if she is in charge of a wafer\\nfabrication plant, her output consists of completed, high-quality, fully processed silicon\\nwafers. If he supervises a design group, his output consists of completed designs that\\nwork correctly and are ready to go into manufacturing. If a manager is the principal\\nof a high school, her output will be trained and educated students who have either\\ncompleted their schooling or are ready to move on to the next year of their studies. If a\\nmanager is a surgeon, his output is a fully recovered, healed patient. We can sum matters\\nup with the proposition that:\\nWhy? Because business and education and even surgery represent work done by teams.\\nby his subordinates and associates. If the manager is a knowledge specialist, a know-how\\nmanager, his potential for influencing “neighboring” organizations is enormous. The\\ninternal consultant who supplies needed insight to a group struggling with a problem\\nwill affect the work and the output of the entire group. Similarly, if a lawyer acquires\\na regulatory permit for a drug company, he will release the flow of the result of many\\nyears of research at that company to the public. Or a marketing analyst who reviews\\nmountains of product, market, and competitive information, analyzes market research,\\nand makes fact-finding visits can directly affect the output of many “neighboring”\\norganizations. His interpretations of the data and his recommendations will perhaps\\nguide the activities for the whole company. Thus, the definition of “manager” should\\nbe broadened: individual contributors who gather and disseminate know-how and.\\ninformation should also be seen as middle managers, because they exert great power\\nwithin the organization.\\nBut the key definition here is that the output of a manager is a result achieved by a\\ngroup either under her supervision or under her influence. While the manager’s own\\nwork is clearly very important, that in itself does not create output. Her organization\\ndoes. By analogy, a coach or a quarterback alone does not score touchdowns and win\\ngames. Entire teams with their participation and guidance and direction do. League\\nstandings are kept by team, not by individual. Business—and this means not just the\\nbusiness of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the\\nbusiness of medicine—is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win.\\nIt is important to understand that a manager will find himself engaging in an array\\nof activities in order to affect output. As the middle managers I queried said, a manager\\nmust form opinions and make judgments, he must provide direction, he must allocate\\nresources, he must detect mistakes, and so on. All these are necessary to achieve output.\\nBut output and activity are by no means the same thing.\\nConsider my own managerial role. As president of a company, I can affect output\\nthrough my direct subordinates—group general managers and others like them—by\\nperforming supervisory activities. I can also influence groups not under my direct\\nsupervision by making observations and suggestions to those who manage them. Both\\ntypes of activity will, I hope, contribute to my output as a manager by contributing to\\nthe output of the company as a whole. I was once asked by a middle manager at Intel\\nhow I could teach in-plant courses, visit manufacturing plants, concern myself with the\\nproblems of people several levels removed from me in the organization, and still have\\ntime to do my job. I asked him what he thought my job was. He thought for a moment,\\nand then answered his own question, “I guess those things are your job too, aren’t they?”\\nThey are absolutely my job—not my entire job, but part of it, because they help add to the\\noutput of Intel.\\nLet me give another example. Cindy, an engineer at Intel, supervises an engineering\\ngroup in a wafer fabrication plant. She also spends some of her time as a member of an\\nadvisory body that establishes standard procedures by which all the plants throughout\\nthe company perform a certain technical process. In both roles, Cindy contributes to the\\noutput of the wafer fabrication plants. As a supervising engineer, she performs activities\\nthat increase the output of the plant in which she works; as a member of the advisory\\nbody, she provides specialized knowledge that will influence and increase the output of\\n“neighboring organizations”—all the other Intel wafer fabrication plants.\\nLet’s refer again to our black box. If the machinery within an organization can be\\ncompared to a series of gears, we can visualize how a middle manager affects output. In\\ntimes of crisis, he provides power to the organization. When things aren’t working as\\nsmoothly as they should, he applies a bit of oil. And, of course, he provides intelligence to\\nthe machine to direct its purpose.\\n“Daddy, What Do You Really Da?”\\nMost of us have had to struggle to answer that question. What we actually do is difficult\\nto pin down and sum up. Much of it often seems so inconsequential that our position in\\nthe business hardly seems justified. Part of the problem here stems from the distinction\\nbetween our activities, which is what we actually do, and our output, which is what\\nwe achieve. The latter seems important, significant, and worthwhile. The former often\\nseems trivial, insignificant, and messy. But a surgeon whose output is a cured patient\\nspends his time scrubbing and cutting and suturing, and this hardly sounds very\\nTo find out what we managers really do, let’s take a look at one of my busier days,\\nshown in the table below.

The\\nnature of the questions, at the same time, gave me\\na feeling for the concerns and understanding level\\nof a large number of employees to whom I would\\nnot otherwise have access.

I dealt with\\nthings in seemingly random fashion. My wife's reaction to my day was that it looked very\\nmuch like one of her own. She was right in noting a similarity. My day always ends when\\nAs you can see, much of my day is spent acquiring information. And as you can\\nalso see, I use many ways to get it. I read standard reports and memos but also get\\ninformation ad hoc. I talk to people inside and outside the company, managers at other\\nfirms or financial analysts or members of the press. Customer complaints, both external\\nand internal, are also a very important source of information. For example, the Intel\\ntraining organization, which I serve as an instructor, is an internal customer of mine.\\nTo cut myself off from the casual complaints of people in that group would be a mistake\\nbecause I would miss getting an evaluation of my performance as an internal “supplier.”\\nPeople also tell us things because they want us to do something for them; to advance\\ntheir case, they will sometimes shower us with useful information. This is something we\\nshould remember, apart from whether we do as they ask.\\nI have to confess that the information most useful to me, and I suspect most useful\\nto all managers, comes from quick, often casual verbal exchanges. This usually reaches\\na manager much faster than anything written down. And usually the more timely the\\ninformation, the more valuable it is.\\nSo why are written reports necessary at all? They obviously can’t provide timely\\ninformation. What they do is constitute an archive of data, help to validate ad hoc\\ninputs, and catch, in safety-net fashion, anything you may have missed. But reports\\nalso have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written, the\\nauthor is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally. Hence their value stems\\nfrom the discipline and the thinking the writer is forced to impose upon himself as he\\nidentifies and deals with trouble spots in his presentation. Reports are more a medium of\\nself-discipline than a way to communicate information. Writing the report is important;\\nreading it often is not.\\nThere are many parallels to this. As we will see later, the preparation of an annual plan\\nis in itself the end, not the resulting bound volume. Similarly, our capital authorization\\nprocess itself is important, not the authorization itself. To prepare and justify a capital\\nspending request, people go through a lot of soul-searching analysis and juggling, and it\\nis this mental exercise that is valuable. The formal authorization is useful only because it\\nenforces the discipline of the process.\\nTo improve and maintain your capacity to get information, you have to understand\\nthe way it comes to you. There’s a hierarchy involved. Verbal sources are the most\\nvaluable, but what they provide is also sketchy, Incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate,\\nlike a newspaper headline that can give you only the general idea of a story. A headline\\ncan't give any of the details and might even give you a distorted idea of what the real\\nstory is. So you then read the newspaper article itself to find out who, what, where,\\nwhy, and how. After this, you should have some reiteration and perspective, which can\\nbe compared to reading a news magazine or even a book. Each level in your information\\nhierarchy is important, and you can rely on none alone. Though the most thorough\\ninformation might come from the news magazine, you do not, of course, want to\\nwait a full week after an event to find out about it. Your information sources should\\ncomplement one another, and also be redundant because that gives you a way to verify\\nwhat you've learned.\\nThere is an especially efficient way to get information, much neglected by most\\nmanagers. That is to visit a particular place in the company and observe what's going\\non there. Why should you do this? Think of what happens when somebody comes to\\nsee a manager in his office. A certain stop-and-start dynamics occurs when the visitor\\nsits down, something socially dictated. While a two-minute kernel of information is\\nexchanged, the meeting often takes a half hour. But if a manager walks through an area\\nand sees a person with whom he has a two-minute concern, he can simply stop, cover it,\\nand be on his way. Ditto for the subordinate when he initiates conversation. Accordingly,\\nsuch visits are an extremely effective and efficient way to transact managerial business.\\nThen why are they underutilized? Because of the awkwardness that managers feel\\nabout walking through an area without a specific task in mind. At Intel we combat\\nthis problem by using programmed visits meant to accomplish formal tasks, but which\\nalso set the stage for ad hoc mini-transactions. For example, we ask our managers\\nto participate in “Mr. Clean” inspections, in which they go to a part of the company\\nthat they normally wouldn’t visit. The managers examine the housekeeping, the\\narrangement of things, the labs, and the safety equipment, and in so doing spend an\\nhour or so browsing around and getting acquainted with things firsthand.\\nAs can be seen from my schedule, a manager not only gathers information but is also\\na source of it. He must convey his knowledge to members of his own organization and\\nto other groups he influences. Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate\\nhis objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are\\napproached. This is extremely important, because only if the manager imparts these\\nwill his subordinates know how to make decisions themselves that will be acceptable to\\nthe manager, their supervisor. Thus, transmitting objectives and preferred approaches\\nconstitutes a key to successful delegation. As we will see later, a shared corporate culture\\nbecomes indispensable to a business. Someone adhering to the values of a corporate\\nculture—an intelligent corporate citizen—will behave in consistent fashion under\\nsimilar conditions, which means that managers don’t have to suffer the inefficiencies\\nengendered by formal rules, procedures, and regulations that are sometimes used to get\\nthe same result.\\nThe third major kind of managerial activity, of course, is decision-making. To be sure,\\nonce in a while we managers in fact make a decision. But for every time that happens, we\\nparticipate in the making of many, many others, and we do that in a variety of ways. We\\nprovide factual inputs or just offer opinions, we debate the pros and cons of alternatives\\nand thereby force a better decision to emerge, we review decisions made or about to be\\nmade by others, encourage or discourage them, ratify or veto them.\\nJust how decisions should be made, we'll talk about later. Meanwhile, let’s say that\\ndecisions can be separated into two kinds. The forward-looking sort are made, for\\nexample, in the capital authorization process. Here we allocate the financial resources\\nof the company among various future undertakings. The second type is made as we\\nrespond to a developing problem or a crisis, which can either be technical (a quality\\ncontrol problem, for example) or involve people (talking somebody out of quitting).\\nIt’s obvious that your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend\\nthe facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is\\nso important in a manager's life. Other activities—conveying information, making\\ndecisions, and being a role model for your subordinates—are all governed by the base of\\ninformation that you, the manager, have about the tasks, the issues, the needs, and the\\nproblems facing your organization. In short, information-gathering is the basis of all\\nother managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it.\\nYou often do things at the office designed to influence events slightly, maybe making\\na phone call to an associate suggesting that a decision be made in a certain way, or\\nsending a note or a memo that shows how you see a particular situation, or making\\na comment during an oral presentation. In such instances you may be advocating\\na preferred course of action, but you are not issuing an instruction or a command.\\nYet you're doing something stronger than merely conveying information. Let’s call it\\n“nudging” because through it you nudge an individual or a meeting in the direction you\\nwould like. This is an immensely important managerial activity in which we engage all\\nthe time, and it should be carefully distinguished from decision-making that results in\\nfirm, clear directives. In reality, for every unambiguous decision we make, we probably\\nnudge things a dozen times.\\nFinally, something more subtle pervades the day of all managers. While we move\\nabout, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are role models for people in our organization\\n—our subordinates, our peers, and even our supervisors. Much has been said and written\\nabout a manager's need to be a leader. The fact is, no single managerial activity can\\nbe said to constitute leadership, and nothing leads as well as example. By this I mean\\nsomething straightforward. Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted\\neasily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effectively by doing and doing visibly.\\nAll managers need to act so that they can be seen exerting influence, but they should\\ndo soin their own way. Some of us feel comfortable dealing with large groups and talking\\nabout our feelings and values openly in that fashion. Others prefer working one-on-\\none with people in a quieter, more intellectual environment. These and other styles of\\nleadership will work, but only if we recognize and consciously stress the need for us to be\\nrole models for people in our organization.\\nDon’t think for a moment that the way I’ve described leadership applies only to large\\noperations. An insurance agent in a small office who continually talks with personal\\nfriends on the phone imparts a set of values about permissible conduct to everyone\\nworking for him. A lawyer who returns to his office after lunch a little drunk does the\\nsame. On the other hand, a supervisor in a company, large or small, who takes his work\\nseriously exemplifies to his associates the most important managerial value of all.\\nA great deal of a manager’s work has to do with allocating resources: manpower,\\nmoney, and capital. But the single most important resource that we allocate from one\\nday to the next is our own time. In principle more money, more manpower, or more\\ncapital can always be made available, but our own time is the one absolutely finite\\nresource we each have. Its allocation and use therefore deserve considerable attention.\\nHow you handle your own time is, in my view, the single most important aspect of being\\narole model and leader.\\nAs you can see, in a typical day of mine one can count some twenty-five separate\\nactivities in which I participated, mostly information-gathering and -giving, but also\\ndecision-making and nudging. You can also see that some two thirds of my time was\\nspent in a meeting of one kind or another. Before you are horrified by how much time\\nI spend in meetings, answer a question: which of the activities—information-gathering,\\ninformation-giving, decision-making, nudging, and being a role model—could I have\\nperformed outside a meeting? The answer is practically none. Meetings provide an\\noccasion for managerial activities. Getting together with others is not, of course, an\\nactivity—it is a medium. You as a manager can do your work in a meeting, in a memo, or\\nthrough a loudspeaker for that matter. But you must choose the most effective medium\\nfor what you want to accomplish, and that is the one that gives you the greatest leverage.\\nMore about meetings later.\\nLeverage of Managerial Activity\\nWe've established that the output of a manager is the output of the various organizations\\nunder his control and his influence. What can a manager do to increase his output?\\nTo find out, let’s look at the concept of leverage. Leverage is the measure of the output\\ngenerated by any given managerial activity. Accordingly, managerial output can be\\nlinked to managerial activity by the equation:\\nManagerial Output Output of organization\\nThis equation says that for every activity a manager performs—A,, A,, and so on—\\nthe output of the organization should increase by some degree. The extent to which that\\noutput is thereby increased is determined by the leverage of that activity—L,, L,, and\\nso on. A manager’s output is thus the sum of the result of individual activities having\\nvarying degrees of leverage. Clearly the key to high output means being sensitive to the\\nleverage of what you do during the day.\\nManagerial productivity—that is, the output of a manager per unit of time worked—\\ncan be increased in three ways:\\n1. Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his\\n2. Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities.\\n3. Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with\\nLet us consider first the leverage of various types of managerial work.\\nThese can be achieved in three basic ways:\\n+ When many people are affected by one manager.\\n+ When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a\\nmanager's brief, well-focused set of words or actions.\\n- When a large group's work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, Key piece\\nof knowledge or information.\\nThe first is the most obvious example. Consider Robin, an Intel finance manager,\\nresponsible for setting up the annual financial planning process for the company. When\\nRobin defines in advance exactly what information needs to be gathered and presented\\nat each stage of the planning process and lays out who is responsible for what, she\\ndirectly affects the subsequent work of perhaps two hundred people who participate in\\nthe planning process. By spending a certain amount of time in advance of the planning\\nactivities, Robin will help to eliminate confusion and ambiguity for a large population\\nof managers over an extended period of time. Consequently, her work contributes to\\nthe productivity of the entire organization and clearly has great leverage, leverage that\\ndepends, however, on when it is performed. Work done in advance of the planning\\nmeeting obviously has great leverage. If Robin has to scramble later to help a manager\\ndefine guidelines and milestones, her work will clearly have much less leverage.\\nAnother example of leverage that depends on timely action is what you do when you\\nlearn that a valued subordinate has decided to quit. In such a case, you must direct\\nyourself to the situation immediately if you want to change the person's mind. If you put\\nit off, all your chances are lost. Thus to maximize the leverage of his activities, a manager\\nmust keep timeliness, which is often critical, firmly in mind.\\nLeverage can also be negative. Some managerial activities can reduce the output of an\\norganization. I mean something very simple. Suppose Iam a key participant at a meeting\\nand I arrive unprepared. Not only dol waste the time of the people attending the meeting\\nbecause of my lack of preparation—a direct cost of my carelessness—but I deprive the\\nother participants of the opportunity to use that time to do something else.\\nEach time a manager imparts his knowledge, skills, or values to a group, his leverage\\nis high, as members of the group will carry what they learn to many others. But again,\\nleverage can be positive or negative. An example of leverage that I hope is high and\\npositive is my talk in the orientation course. During the two hours I have, I try to impart\\na great deal of information about Intel—its history, its objectives, its values, its style—\\nto a group of two hundred new employees. Besides what I say specifically, my approach\\ntoward answering questions and my conduct in general communicate our way of doing\\nthings to these employees when they are most impressionable.\\nHere is another example of this kind of leverage. To train a group of salesmen, Barbara,\\nan Intel marketing engineer, sets out to teach them what the organization’s products are.\\nIf she does her job well, the salespeople will be better equipped to sell the line. If she does\\nit poorly, great and obvious damage is done.\\nA final, less formal, example here: Cindy, as you recall, is a member of a technical\\ncoordinating body in which she tries to disseminate her understanding of a specific\\ntechnology to all of the company’s manufacturing groups. In effect, she uses the\\ncoordinating body as an informal training vehicle to effect high leverage on her\\ncounterparts in neighboring Intel organizations.\\nA manager can also exert high leverage by engaging in an activity that takes him\\nonly a short time, but that affects another person’s performance over a long time. A\\nperformance review represents a good example of this. With the few hours’ work that\\na manager spends preparing and delivering the review, he can affect the work of its\\nrecipient enormously. Here too a manager can exert either positive or negative leverage.\\nA subordinate can be motivated and even redirected in his efforts, or the review can\\ndiscourage and demoralize him for who knows how long.\\nAnother seemingly trivial piece of work—creating a tickler file—can improve daily\\nwork significantly for a long time. Setting up the simple mechanical aid is a one-\\ntime activity, yet it is likely to improve the productivity of the manager who uses it\\nindefinitely. Thus the leverage here is very, very high.\\nExamples of high negative leverage abound. After going through the annual planning\\nprocess, an Intel manager saw that, in spite of successful cost reduction efforts in the\\nprior year, his division was still not going to make any money in the coming year. The\\nmanager became depressed. Though he didn’t realize it, he almost immediately began\\nto affect people around him and soon depression spread throughout his organization.\\nHe snapped out of it only when someone on his staff finally told him what he was\\ndoing to the people under him. Another example is waffling, when a manager puts off a\\ndecision that will affect the work of other people. In effect, the lack of a decision is the\\nBoth the depressed and the waffling manager can have virtually unlimited negative\\nleverage. If people are badly affected by a poor sales training effort, the situation can\\nbe handled by retraining the group. But the negative leverage produced by depression\\nand waffling is very hard to counter because their impact on an organization is both so\\npervasive and so elusive.\\nManagerial meddling is also an example of negative leverage. This occurs when\\na supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a subordinate’s\\nwork things through himself. For example, if a senior manager sees an indicator\\nshowing an undesirable trend and dictates to the person responsible a detailed set of\\nactions to be taken, that is managerial meddling. In general, meddling stems from\\na supervisor exploiting too much superior work knowledge (real or imagined). The\\nnegative leverage produced comes from the fact that after being exposed to many such\\ninstances, the subordinate will begin to take a much more restricted view of what is\\nexpected of him, showing less initiative in solving his own problems and referring them\\ninstead to his supervisor. Because the output of the organization will consequently be\\nreduced in the long run, meddling is clearly an activity having negative managerial\\nThe third kind of managerial activity with high leverage is exercised by a person with\\nunique skills and knowledge. One such person is an Intel marketing engineer responsible\\nfor setting prices for the product line. Hundreds of salespeople in the field can be\\nnegatively affected if prices are set too high: no matter how hard they may try, they won't\\nbe able to get any business. Of course, if the prices were set too low, we would be giving\\nTake another example. An Intel development engineer who has uniquely detailed\\nknowledge of a particular manufacturing process effectively controls how it is used.\\nSince the process will eventually provide the foundation for the work of many\\nproduct designers all over the company, the leverage the development engineer exerts\\nis enormous. The same is true for a geologist in an oil company or an actuary in\\nan insurance firm. All are specialists whose work is important for the work of their\\norganization at large. The person who comprehends the critical facts or has the critical\\ninsights—the “knowledge specialist” or the “know-how manager”—has tremendous\\nauthority and influence on the work of others, and therefore very high leverage.\\nThe art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of\\nseemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well\\nbeyond the others and concentrate on them. For me, paying close attention to customer\\ncomplaints constitutes a high-leverage activity. Aside from making a customer happy,\\nthe pursuit tends to produce important insights into the workings of my own operation.\\nSuch complaints may be numerous, and though all of them need to be followed up\\nby someone, they don't all require or wouldn't all benefit from my personal attention.\\nWhich one out of ten or twenty complaints to dig into, analyze, and follow up is where\\nart comes into the work of a manager. The basis of that art is an intuition that behind\\nthis complaint and not the other lurk many deeper problems.\\nDELEGATION AS LEVERAGE\\nBecause managerial time has a hierarchy of values, delegation is an essential aspect of\\nmanagement. The “delegator” and “delegatee” must share a common information base\\nand a common set of operational ideas or notions on how to go about solving problems, a\\nrequirement that is frequently not met. Unless both parties share the relevant common\\nbase, the delegatee can become an effective proxy only with specific instructions. As in\\nmeddling, where specific activities are prescribed in detail, this produces low managerial\\nPicture this. Iam your supervisor, and I walk over to you with pencil in hand and tell\\nyou to take it. You reach for the pencil, but I won't let go. So I say, “What is wrong with\\nyou? Why can't I delegate the pencil to you?” We all have some things that we don't really\\nwant to delegate simply because we like doing them and would rather not let go. For your\\nmanagerial effectiveness, this is not too bad so long as it is based on a conscious decision\\nthat you will hold on to certain tasks that you enjoy performing, even though you could,\\nif you chose, delegate them. But be sure to know exactly what you're doing, and avoid\\nthe charade of insincere delegation, which can produce immense negative managerial\\nGiven a choice, should you delegate activities that are familiar to you or those that\\naren't? Before answering, consider the following principle: delegation without follow-\\nthrough is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate\\nit, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is\\nthe only practical way for you to ensure a result. Monitoring is not meddling, but means\\nchecking to make sure an activity is proceeding in line with expectations. Because it is\\neasier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should\\ndelegate those activities you know best. But recall the pencil experiment and understand\\nbefore the fact that this will very likely go against your emotional grain.\\nPlease turn back to the table of my day’s activities on this page. During the executive\\nstaff meeting we heard two follow-up presentations, one on the status of an extremely\\nimportant marketing program and the other on the progress of a program aimed at\\nreducing manufacturing throughput times. Both reviews are examples of monitoring.\\nEarlier, we had assigned each to a middle manager and made sure these managers and\\nthe senior staff agreed about what the programs were to be. The middle managers then\\nwent about their business expecting to report back to the executive staff, the body that\\ndelegated the programs to them.\\nMonitoring the results of delegation resembles the monitoring used in quality\\nassurance. We should apply quality assurance principles and monitor at the lowest-\\nadded-value stage of the process. For example, review rough drafts of reports that you\\nhave delegated; don’t wait until your subordinates have spent time polishing them into\\nfinal form before you find out that you have a basic problem with the contents. A second\\nprinciple applies to the frequency with which you check your subordinates’ work. A\\nvariable approach should be employed, using different sampling schemes with various\\nsubordinates; you should increase or decrease your frequency depending on whether\\nyour subordinate is performing a newly delegated task or one that he has experience\\nhandling. How often you monitor should not be based on what you believe your\\nsubordinate can do in general, but on his experience with a specific task and his prior\\nperformance with it—his task-relevant maturity, something I'll talk about in detail later.\\nAs the subordinate’s work improves over time, you should respond with a corresponding\\nreduction in the intensity of the monitoring.\\nTo use quality assurance principles effectively, the manager should only go into\\ndetails randomly, just enough to try to ensure that the subordinate is moving ahead\\nsatisfactorily. To check into all the details of a delegated task would be like quality\\nassurance testing 100 percent of what manufacturing turned out.\\nMaking certain types of decisions is something managers frequently delegate to\\nsubordinates. How is this best done? By monitoring their decision-making process. How\\ndo you do that? Let’s examine what Intel goes through to approve a capital equipment\\npurchase. We ask a subordinate to think through the entire matter carefully before\\npresenting a request for approval. And to monitor how good his thinking is, we ask him\\nquite specific questions about his request during a review meeting. If he answers them\\nconvincingly, we'll approve what he wants. This technique allows us to find out how\\ngood the thinking is without having to go through it ourselves.\\nIncreasing Managerial Activity Rate: Speeding Up the Line\\nOf course, the most obvious way to increase managerial output is to increase the rate, or\\nspeed, of performing work. The relationship here is:\\nwhere L is the leverage of the activity.\\nThe most common approach to increasing a manager’s productivity—his output over\\ntime—has been time-management techniques, which try to reduce the denominator on\\nboth sides of this equation. Any number of consultants will tell a manager that the way\\nto higher productivity is to handle a piece of paper only once, to hold only stand-up\\nmeetings (which will presumably be short), and to turn his desk so that he presents his\\nback to the door.\\nThese time-management suggestions can be improved upon, I think, by applying our\\nproduction principles. First, we must identify our limiting step: what is the “egg” in\\nour work? In a manager’s life some things really have to happen on a schedule that is\\nabsolute. For me, an example is the class I teach. I know when it is going to meet, and I\\nknow I must prepare for it. There is no “give” in the time here, because over two hundred\\nstudents will be expecting me. Accordingly, I have to create offsets and schedule my\\nother work around this limiting step. In short, if we determine what is immovable and\\nmanipulate the more yielding activities around it, we can work more efficiently.\\nA second production principle we can apply to managerial work is batching similar\\ntasks. Any manufacturing operation requires a certain amount of set-up time. So for\\nmanagerial work to proceed efficiently, we should use the same set-up effort to apply\\nacross a group of similar activities. Think about our continuous egg-boiler, which was\\ninstalled to produce fine-quality, identical, three-minute eggs. Should we now decide to\\nserve our customers four-minute eggs, we would have to slow down the conveyor belt\\nmoving them through the hot water. The adjustment takes time: not only do we adjust\\nnuts and bolts on the machine, we also have to inspect the quality of the four-minute\\neggs by sampling a few of them.\\nSet-up time has many parallels in managerial work. For example, once we have\\nprepared a set of illustrations for a training class, we will obviously increase our\\nproductivity if we can use the same set over and over again with other classes or groups.\\nSimilarly, if a manager has a number of reports to read or a number of performance\\nreviews to approve, he should set aside a block of time and do a batch of them together,\\none after the other, to maximize the use of the mental set-up time needed for the task.\\nWhat makes running a factory different from running a job shop? The latter is\\nprepared to service any customer who drops in; the owner handles the job required\\nand moves on to the next one. A factory, on the other hand, is usually run by forecast\\nand not by individual order. From my experience a large portion of managerial work\\ncan be forecasted. Accordingly, forecasting those things you can and setting yourself up\\nto do them is only common sense and an important way to minimize the feeling and\\nthe reality of fragmentation experienced in managerial work. Forecasting and planning\\nyour time around key events are literally like running an efficient factory.\\nWhat is the medium of a manager’s forecast? It is something very simple: his calendar.\\nMost people use their calendars as a repository of “orders” that come in. Someone throws\\nan order to a manager for his time, and it automatically shows up on his calendar. This\\nis mindless passivity. To gain better control of his time, the manager should use his\\nAnother production principle can be applied here. Because manufacturing people\\ntrust their indicators, they won't allow material to begin its journey through the factory\\nif they think it is already operating at capacity. If they did, material might go halfway\\nthrough and back up behind a bottleneck. Instead, factory managers say “no” at the\\noutset and keep the start level from overloading the system. Other kinds of managers\\nfind this hard to apply because their indicators of capacity are not as well established or\\nnot as believable. How much time do you need to read your mail, to write your reports,\\nto meet with a colleague? You may not know precisely, but you surely have a feel for the\\ntime required. And you should exploit that sense to schedule your work.\\nTo use your calendar as a production-planning tool, you must accept responsibility\\nfor two things:\\n1. You should move toward the active use of your calendar, taking the initiative\\nto fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though\\n2. You should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.\\nmeans losing more money and time. You can obviously say “no” either explicitly\\nor implicitly, because by not delivering you end up saying what amounts to “no.”\\nRemember too that your time is your one finite resource, and when you say “yes” to one\\nthing you are inevitably saying “no” to another.\\nThe next production principle you can apply is to allow slack—a bit of looseness in\\nyour scheduling. Highway planners, for example, know that a freeway can handle an\\noptimum number of vehicles. Having fewer cars means that the road is not being used at\\ncapacity. But at that optimum point, ifjust afew more cars are allowed to enter the traffic\\nflow, everything comes to a crunching halt. With the new metering devices that control\\naccess during the rush hour, planners can get a fix on the right number. The same thing\\ncan be done for managerial work. There is an optimum degree of loading, with enough\\nslack built in so that one unanticipated phone call will not ruin your schedule for the rest\\nof the day. You need some slack.\\nAnother production principle is very nearly the opposite. A manager should carry a\\nraw material inventory in terms of projects. This is not to be confused with his work-in-\\nprocess inventory, because that, like eggs in a continuous boiler, tends to spoil or become\\nobsolete over time. Instead this inventory should consist of things you need to do but\\ndon’t need to finish right away—discretionary projects, the kind the manager can work\\non to increase his group's productivity over the long term. Without such an inventory\\nof projects, a manager will most probably use his free time meddling in his subordinates’\\nA final principle. Most production practices follow well-established procedures and,\\nrather than reinventing the wheel repeatedly, use a specific method that has been shown\\nto work before. But managers tend to be inconsistent and bring a welter of approaches to\\nthe same task. We should work to change that. As we become more consistent, we should\\nalso remember that the value of an administrative procedure is contained not in formal\\nstatements but in the real thinking that led to its establishment. This means that even as\\nwe try to standardize what we do, we should continue to think critically about what we\\ndo and the approaches we use.\\nBuilt-In Leverage: How Many Subordinates Should You Have...\\nAn important component of managerial leverage is the number of subordinates a\\nmanager has. [f he does not have enough, his leverage is obviously reduced. If he has too\\nmany, he gets bogged down—with the same result. As a rule of thumb, a manager whose\\nwork is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates; three or four are too\\nfew and ten are too many. This range comes from a guideline that a manager should\\nallocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates. (Two days a week per\\nsubordinate would probably lead to meddling; an hour a week does not provide enough\\nopportunity for monitoring.)\\nThe six to eight rule is right for the classically hierarchical manager whose primary\\nwork is the supervision of others. What about a know-how manager, the middle\\nmanager who mainly supplies expertise and information? Even if he works without a\\nsingle subordinate, servicing a number of varied “customers” as an internal consultant\\ncan in itself be a full-time job. In fact, anyone who spends about a half day per week\\nas a member of a planning, advisory, or coordinating group has the equivalent of a\\nsubordinate. So as a rule of thumb, if a manager is both a hierarchical supervisor and a\\nsupplier of know-how, he should try to have a total of six to eight subordinates or their\\nSometimes a business is organized in a way that makes the ideal fan-out of six to\\neight subordinates hard to reach. A manufacturing plant, for example, may have an\\nengineering section and a production section, in which case the plant manager would\\nonly have two people reporting directly to him. The manager might then choose to\\n“act” as one of the two subordinates, choosing to be his own engineering manager, for\\ninstance. If he does that, the manufacturing manager will still report to him, and he\\nwill have added the people who would ordinarily report to the head of engineering.\\nSo the plant manager will actually have six direct reports: five engineers and the\\nmanufacturing manager. The arrangement, shown below, does not have the engineers\\nappearing to be at the same organizational level as the manufacturing manager—\\nsomething he would surely take exception to.\\nManufacturing E = Manufacturing\\nManager Manager anager\\nNOT OK OK\\nThis arrangement will avoid forcing the plant manager either\\ninto on-the-job retirement or inte meddling.\\nInterruptions—The Plague of Managerial Work\\nThe next important production concept we can apply to managerial work is to strive\\ntoward regularity, We could obviously run our breakfast factory more efficiently if\\ncustomers arrived in a steady and predictable stream rather than dropping in by ones\\nand twos. Though we can’t control our customers’ habits, we should try to smooth out\\nour workload as much as possible. As noted, we should try to make our managerial\\nwork take on the characteristics of a factory, not a job shop. Accordingly, we should do\\neverything we can to prevent little stops and starts in our day as well as interruptions\\nbrought on by big emergencies. Even though some of the latter are unavoidable, we\\nshould always be looking for sources of future high-priority trouble by cutting windows\\ninto the black box of our organization. Recognizing you've got a time bomb on your\\nhands means you can address a problem when you want to, not after the bomb has gone\\nBut because you must coordinate your work with that of other managers, you can\\nonly move toward regularity if others do too. In other words, the same blocks of time\\nmust be used for like activities. For example, at Intel Monday mornings have been set\\naside throughout the corporation as the time when planning groups meet. So anybody\\nwho belongs to one can count on Monday for that purpose and be free of scheduling\\nAbout twenty middle managers at Intel were once asked to be part of an experiment.\\nAfter pairing up, they tried some role-playing in which one manager was to define the\\nproblem most limiting his output and the other was to be a consultant who would\\nanalyze the problem and propose solutions.\\nThe most common problem cited was uncontrolled interruptions, which in remarkably\\nuniform fashion affected both supervisory and know-how managers. Everyone felt that\\nthe interruptions got in the way of his “own” work. Interruptions had a common source,\\nmost frequently coming from subordinates and from people outside the managers’\\nimmediate organization but whose work the managers influenced. For those in\\nmanufacturing, the interruptions most often came from production operators, and for\\nmarketing people, from outside customers: in short, from the consumers of the middle\\nmanagers’ authority and information.\\nThe most frequently proposed solutions were not very practical. The idea mentioned\\nmost often was to create blocks of time for individual work by hiding physically. But\\nthis is a less than happy answer, because the interrupters obviously have legitimate\\nproblems, and if the manager responded by hiding, these would pile up. One “solution”\\nwas a suggestion that customers not call marketing managers at certain hours. No good.\\nThere are better ways. Let’s apply a production concept. Manufacturers turn out\\nstandard products. By analogy, if you can pin down what kind of interruptions you're\\ngetting, you can prepare standard responses for those that pop up most often. Customers\\ndon’t come up with totally new questions and problems day in and day out, and because\\nthe same ones tend to surface repeatedly, a manager can reduce time spent handling\\ninterruptions using standard responses. Having them available also means that a\\nmanager can delegate much of the job to less experienced personnel.\\nAlso, if you use the production principle of batching—that is, handling a group of\\nsimilar chores at one time—many interruptions that come from your subordinates can\\nbe accumulated and handled not randomly, but at staff and at one-on-one meetings, the\\nsubject of the next chapter. If such meetings are held regularly, people can't protest too\\nmuch if they’re asked to batch questions and problems for scheduled times, instead of\\ninterrupting you whenever they want.\\nThe use of indicators, especially the bank of indicators kept over time, can also\\nreduce the time a manager spends dealing with interruptions. How fast he can answer\\na question depends on how fast he can put his finger on the information he needs for a\\nresponse. By maintaining an archive of information, a manager doesn’t have to do ad hoc\\nresearch every time the phone rings.\\nIf the people who interrupt you knew how much they were disturbing you, they\\nwould probably police themselves more closely and cut down on the number of times\\nthey felt they had to talk to you right away. In any case, a manager should try to force\\nhis frequent interrupters to make an active decision about whether an issue can wait.\\nSo, instead of going into hiding, a manager can hang a sign on his door that says, “I am\\ndoing individual work. Please don't interrupt me unless it really can't wait until 2:00.”\\nThen hold an open office hour, and be completely receptive to anybody who wants to see\\nyou. The key is this: understand that interrupters have legitimate problems that need\\nto be handled. That’s why they’re bringing them to you. But you can channel the time\\nneeded to deal with them into organized, scheduled form by providing an alternative to\\ninterruption—a scheduled meeting or an office hour.\\nThe point is to impose a pattern on the way a manager copes with problems. To make\\nsomething regular that was once irregular is a fundamental production principle, and\\nthat’s how you should try to handle the interruptions that plague you.\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dapta/Texts/High Output Management Chapter 3 Managerial Leverage.txt'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Meetings have a bad name. One school of management thought considers them the curse\\nof the manager's existence. Someone who did a study found that managers spend up\\nto 50 percent of their time in meetings, and implied that this was time wasted. Peter\\nDrucker once said that spending more than 25 percent of his time in meetings is a sign\\nof a manager's malorganization, and William H. Whyte, Jr., in his book The Organization\\nMan, described meetings as “non-contributory labor” that managers must endure.\\nThe two basic managerial roles produce two basic kinds of meetings. In the first\\nkind of meeting, called a process-oriented meeting, knowledge is shared and information\\nis exchanged. Such meetings take place on a regularly scheduled basis. The purpose of\\nthe second kind of meeting is to solve a specific problem. Meetings of this sort, called\\nmission-oriented, frequently produce a decision. They are ad hoc affairs, not scheduled\\nlong in advance, because they usually can’t be.\\nTo make the most of this kind of meeting, we should aim to infuse it with regularity. In\\nother words, the people attending should know how the meeting is run, what kinds of\\nsubstantive matters are discussed, and what is to be accomplished. It should be designed\\nto allow a manager to “batch” transactions, to use the same “production” set-up time and\\neffort to take care of many similar managerial tasks. Moreover, given the regularity, you\\nand the others attending can begin to forecast the time required for the kinds of work\\nto be done. Hence, a “production control” system, as recorded on various calendars, can\\ntake shape, which means that a scheduled meeting will have minimum impact on other\\nthings people are doing.\\nAt Intel we use three kinds of process-oriented meetings: the one-on-one, the staff\\nmeeting, and the operation review.\\nAt Intel, a one-on-one is a meeting between a supervisor and a subordinate, and it\\nis the principal way their business relationship is maintained. Its main purpose is\\nmutual teaching and exchange of information. By talking about specific problems and\\nsituations, the supervisor teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how, and suggests\\nways to approach things. At the same time, the subordinate provides the supervisor with\\ndetailed information about what he is doing and what he is concerned about. From what\\nI can tell, regularly scheduled one-on-ones are highly unusual outside of Intel. When I\\nask a manager from another company about the practice, I usually get an “Oh no, I don't\\nneed scheduled meetings with my supervisor [or subordinate]; I see him several times a\\nday...” But there is an enormous difference between a casual encounter by a supervisor\\nand a subordinate, or even a meeting (mission-oriented) to resolve a specific problem,\\nand a one-on-one.\\nWhen Intel was a young company, I realized that even though I was expected to\\nsupervise both engineering and manufacturing, I knew very little about the company’s\\nfirst product line, memory devices. I also didn’t know much about manufacturing\\ntechniques, my background having been entirely in semiconductor device research. So\\ntwo of my associates, both of whom reported to me, agreed to give me private lessons\\non memory design and manufacturing. These took place by appointment, and involved\\na teacher/subordinate preparing for each; during the session the pupil/supervisor busily\\ntook notes, trying to learn. As Intel grew, the initial tone and spirit of such one-on-ones\\nendured and grew.\\nWho should have a one-on-one? In some situations a supervisor should perhaps meet\\nwith all those who work under him, from professionals to production operators. But here\\nI want to talk about one-on-ones between a supervisor and each of the professionals who\\nreport to him directly.\\nHow often should you have one-on-ones? Or put another way, how do you decide\\nhow often somebody needs such a meeting? The answer is the job- or task-relevant\\nmaturity of each of your subordinates. In other words, how much experience does a\\ngiven subordinate have with the specific task at hand? This is not the same as the\\nexperience he has in general or how old he is. As we will see later, the most effective\\nmanagement style in a specific instance varies from very close to very loose supervision\\nas a subordinate’s task maturity increases. Accordingly, you should have one-on-\\nones frequently (for example, once a week) with a subordinate who is inexperienced\\nin a specific situation and less frequently (perhaps once every few weeks) with an\\nAnother consideration here is how quickly things change in a job area. In marketing,\\nfor example, the pace may be so rapid that a supervisor needs to have frequent one-\\non-ones to keep current on what’s happening. But in a research environment, life may\\nbe quieter, and for a given level of task-relevant maturity, less frequent meetings may\\nHow long should a one-on-one meeting last? There really is no answer to this, but the\\nsubordinate must feel that there is enough time to broach and get into thorny issues.\\nLook at it this way. If you had a big problem that you wanted to kick around with your\\nsupervisor—the person whose professional interest in the matter is second only to yours\\n—would you want to bring it up in a meeting scheduled to last only fifteen minutes? You\\nwould not. I feel that a one-on-one should last an hour at a minimum. Anything less, in\\nmy experience, tends to make the subordinate confine himself to simple things that can\\nbe handled quickly.\\nWhere should a one-on-one take place? In the supervisor's office, in the subordinate’s\\noffice, or somewhere else? I think you should have the meeting in or near the\\nsubordinate’s work area if possible. A supervisor can learn a lot simply by going to\\nhis subordinate’s office. Is he organized or not? Does he repeatedly have to spend time\\nlooking for a document he wants? Does he get interrupted all the time? Never? And in\\ngeneral, how does the subordinate approach his work?\\nA key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting,\\nwith its agenda and tone set by him. There’s good reason for this. Somebody needs to\\nprepare for the meeting. The supervisor with eight subordinates would have to prepare\\neight times; the subordinate only once. So the latter should be asked to prepare an\\noutline, which is very important because it forces him to think through in advance all of\\nthe isswes and points he plans to raise. Moreover, with an outline, the supervisor knows\\nat the outset what is to be covered and can therefore help to set the pace of the meeting\\naccording to the “meatiness” of the items on the agenda. An outline also provides\\na framework for supporting information, which the subordinate should prepare in\\nadvance. The subordinate should then walk the supervisor through all the material.\\nWhat should be covered in a one-on-one? We can start with performance figures,\\nindicators used by the subordinate, such as incoming order rates, production output, or\\nproject status. Emphasis should be on indicators that signal trouble. The meeting should\\nalso cover anything important that has happened since the last meeting: current hiring\\nproblems, people problems in general, organizational problems and future plans, and—\\nvery, very important—potential problems. Even when a problem isn’t tangible, even if\\nit’s only an intuition that something’s wrong, a subordinate owes it to his supervisor to\\ntell him, because it triggers a look into the organizational black box. The most important\\ncriterion governing matters to be talked about is that they be issues that preoccupy and\\nnag the subordinate. These are often obscure and take time to surface, consider, and\\nWhat is the role of the supervisor in a one-on-one? He should facilitate the\\nsubordinate’s expression of what's going on and what's bothering him. The supervisor is\\nthere to learn and to coach. Peter Drucker sums up the supervisor's job here very nicely:\\n“The good time users among managers do not talk to their subordinates about their\\nproblems but they know how to make the subordinates talk about theirs.”\\nHow is this done? By applying Grove's Principle of Didactic Management, “Ask one\\nmore question!” When the supervisor thinks the subordinate has said all he wants to\\nabout a subject, he should ask another question. He should try to keep the flow of\\nthoughts coming by prompting the subordinate with queries until both feel satisfied\\nthat they have gotten to the bottom of a problem.\\nI'd like to suggest some mechanical hints for effective one-on-one meetings. First,\\nboth the supervisor and subordinate should have a copy of the outline and both should\\ntake notes on it, which serves a number of purposes. I take notes in just about all\\ncircumstances, and most often end up never looking at them again. I do it to keep my\\nmind from drifting and also to help me digest the information I hear and see. Since I take\\nnotes in outline form, I am forced to categorize the information logically, which helps me\\nto absorb it. Equally important is what “writing it down” symbolizes. Many issues in a\\none-on-one lead to action required on the part of the subordinate. When he takes a note\\nimmediately following the supervisor's suggestion, the act implies a commitment, like\\na handshake, that something will be done. The supervisor, also having taken notes, can\\nthen follow up at the next one-on-one.\\nA real time-saver is using a “hold” file where both the supervisor and subordinate\\naccumulate important but not altogether urgent issues for discussion at the next\\nmeeting. This kind of file applies the production principle of batching and saves time\\nfor both involved by minimizing the need for ad hoc contact—like phone calls, drop-in\\nvisits, and so on—which constitute the interruptions we considered earlier.\\nThe supervisor should also encourage the discussion of heart-to-heart issues during\\none-on-ones, because this is the perfect forum for getting at subtle and deep work-\\nrelated problems affecting his subordinate. Is he satisfied with his own performance?\\nDoes some frustration or obstacle gnaw at him? Does he have doubts about where he\\nis going? But the supervisor should be wary of the “zinger,” which is a heart-to-heart\\nissue brought up at an awkward time. More often than not, these come near the end\\nof a meeting. If you let that happen, the subordinate might tell you something like he’s\\nunhappy and has been looking outside for a job and give you only five minutes to deal\\nLong-distance telephone one-on-ones have become necessary because many\\norganizations are now spread out geographically. But these can work well enough with\\nproper preparation and attention: the supervisor must have the outline before the\\nmeeting begins, both parties should take notes, and so on. Because you can't see the\\nother participant in the meeting, note-taking can’t work in the same way as in a face-\\nto-face meeting. Exchanging notes after the meeting is a way to make sure each knows\\nwhat the other committed himself to do.\\nOne-on-ones should be scheduled on a rolling basis—setting up the next one as the\\nmeeting taking place ends. Other commitments can thereby be taken into account and\\ncancellations avoided. If the supervisor uses a set schedule for a one-on-one, such as\\nevery second Wednesday morning, and if the subordinate’s vacation happens to fall on\\nthat date, the meeting is not going to occur. By scheduling on a rolling basis, this can be\\nWhat is the leverage of the one-on-one? Let’s say you have a one-on-one with your\\nsubordinate every two weeks, and it lasts one and a half hours. Ninety minutes of your\\ntime can enhance the quality of your subordinate’s work for two weeks, or for some\\neighty-plus hours, and also upgrade your understanding of what he’s doing. Clearly,\\none-on-ones can exert enormous leverage. This happens through the development of a\\ncommon base of information and similar ways of doing and handling things between\\nthe supervisor and the subordinate. And this, as noted, is the only way in which efficient\\nand effective delegation can take place.\\nAt the same time, the subordinate teaches the supervisor, and what is learned is\\nabsolutely essential if the supervisor is to make good decisions. During a recent one-on-\\none meeting, my subordinate, who is responsible for Intel's sales organization, reviewed\\ntrend indicators of incoming orders. While I was vaguely familiar with them, he laid out\\na lot of specific information and convinced me that our business had stopped growing.\\nEven though the summer is typically slow, he proved to me that what was going on\\nwas not just seasonal. After we pondered the data for a while and considered their\\nrelationship to other indicators of business activity in our industry, we came to the\\nreluctant conclusion that business was in fact slowing down. This meant we should take\\na conservative approach to near-term investment—no small matter.\\nBy sharing his base of information with me, the two of us developed a congruent\\nattitude, approach, and conclusion: conservatism in our expansion plans. He left the\\nmeeting having decided to scale back growth in his own area of responsibility. I left\\nhaving decided to share what we had concluded with the business groups I supervised.\\nThus, this one-on-one produced substantial leverage: the Intel sales manager affected all\\nthe other managers who reported to me.\\nTo digress a bit, I also think that one-on-ones at home can help family life. As the\\nfather of two teenage daughters, I have found that the conversation in such a time\\ntogether is very different in tone and kind from what we say to each other in other\\ncircumstances. The one-on-one makes each of us take the other seriously and allows\\nsubtle and complicated matters to come up for discussion. Obviously, no notes are taken,\\nas father and daughter usually go out for dinner at a restaurant, but a family one-on-one\\nvery much resembles a business one-on-one. I strongly recommend both practices.\\nA staff meeting is one in which a supervisor and all of his subordinates participate, and\\nwhich therefore presents an opportunity for interaction among peers. As we will see\\nlater, peer interaction—especially decision-making by a group of peers—is not easy. Yet\\nit is key to good management. The approach to decision-making that we advocate in\\nthe next chapter, as well as the workings of the principle of dual reporting (Chapter 9),\\ndepend on a group of peers working well together. By learning how this happens in staff\\nmeetings, where a group of peers get to know each other, and where the presence of a\\ncommon supervisor helps peer interaction to develop, managers will be prepared to be\\nmembers of other working bodies based on peer groups.\\nStaff meetings also create opportunities for the supervisor to learn from the\\nexchange and confrontation that often develops. In my own case, I get a much better\\nunderstanding of an issue with which I am not familiar by listening to two people with\\nopposing views discuss it than I do by listening to one side only.\\nMy first experience with staff meetings dates back to my early professional years\\nwhen I was the head of a small group of engineers doing semiconductor device research.\\nEveryone in this group worked on an isolated aspect of a problem or on a different\\nproblem altogether. I was supposed to be the supervisor, but I found that others in the\\ngroup were often more familiar with the work of another researcher than I was. Thus, a\\ngroup discussion on any subject tended to get more detailed and more heated, but always\\nmore rewarding, than an exchange between me and one other specialist.\\nWhat should be discussed at a staff meeting? Anything that affects more than two of\\nthe people present. If the meeting degenerates into a conversation between two people\\nworking on a problem affecting only them, the supervisor should break it off and move\\non to something else that will include more of the staff, while suggesting that the two\\ncontinue their exchange later.\\nHow structured should the meeting be? A free-for-all brainstorming session or\\ncontrolled with a detailed agenda? It should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued\\nfar enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their\\nthoughts for the meeting. But it should also include an “open session”—a designated\\nperiod of time for the staff to bring up anything they want. This is when a varied set of\\nhousekeeping matters can be disposed of, as well as when important issues can be given\\na tentative first look. If it is justified, you can provide time for a more formal discussion\\nabout an issue in the scheduled portion of a future meeting.\\nWhat is the role of the supervisor in the staff meeting—a leader, observer, expediter,\\nquestioner, decision-maker? The answer, of course, is all of them. Please note that\\nlecturer is not listed. A supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which\\nis the surest way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting's basic purpose.\\nThe figure opposite shows that the supervisor’s most important roles are being a\\nmeeting’s moderator and facilitator, and controller of its pace and thrust. Ideally, the\\nsupervisor should keep things on track, with the subordinates bearing the brunt of\\nworking the issues. Staff meetings are an ideal medium for decision-making, because the\\ngroup of managers present has typically worked together for a long time. The formal as\\nwell as informal authority of each individual has been well established, and everybody\\nknows who likes to spout off, who tends to daydream, who knows what stuff and so on.\\nA staff meeting is like the dinner-table conversation of a family, while other forums of\\ninteraction at work, involving people who don’t know each other very well, are like a\\ngroup of strangers having to make a decision together.\\nINACTIVE ON TRACK REGION\\nThe supervisor's effort at a staff meeting should go into keeping the discussion\\non track, with the subordinates bearing the brunt of working the issues.\\nThis is the medium of interaction for people who don’t otherwise have much\\nopportunity to deal with one another. The format here should include formal\\npresentations in which managers describe their work to other managers who are not\\ntheir immediate supervisors, and to peers in other parts of the company. The basic\\npurpose of an operation review at Intel is to keep the teaching and learning going on\\nbetween employees several organizational levels apart—people who don’t have one-on-\\nones or staff meetings with each other. This is important for both the junior and senior\\nmanager. The junior person will benefit from the comments, criticisms, and suggestions\\nof the senior manager, who in turn will get a different feel for problems from people\\nfamiliar with their details. Such meetings are also a source of motivation: managers\\nmaking the presentations will want to leave a good impression on their supervisor's\\nsupervisor and on their outside peers.\\nWho are the players at an operation review? The organizing manager, the reviewing\\nmanager, the presenters, and the audience. Each of these players has a distinct role to\\nplay if the review is to be a useful one.\\nThe supervisor of the presenting managers—an Intel divisional marketing manager,\\nlet’s say—should organize the meeting. He should help the presenters decide what issues\\nshould be talked about and what should not, what should be emphasized, and what level\\nof detail to go into. The supervisor should also be in charge of housekeeping (the meeting\\nroom, visual materials, invitations, and so on). Finally, he should be the timekeeper,\\nscheduling the presentations and keeping them moving along. Though it’s hard to judge\\nin advance the time needed for any discussion, the supervisor has presumably had\\nmore experience running meetings. In any case, he should pace the presenters using\\ninconspicuous gestures, so that the manager talking doesn't suddenly find himself out\\nof time with only half his points covered.\\nThe reviewing manager is the senior supervisor at whom the review is aimed—\\nlike the general manager of an Intel division. He has a very important although more\\nsubtle role to play: he should ask questions, make comments, and in general impart\\nthe appropriate spirit to the meeting. He is the catalyst needed to provoke audience\\nparticipation, and by his example he should encourage free expression. He should never\\npreview the material, since that will keep him from reacting spontaneously. Because the\\nsenior supervisor is a role model for the junior managers present, he should take his role\\nat the review extremely seriously.\\nThe people presenting the reviews—a group of marketing supervisors, for example—\\nshould use visual aids such as overhead transparencies to the extent possible. People are\\nendowed with eyes as well as ears, and the simultaneous use of both definitely helps\\nthe audience understand the points being made. But care must be taken, because all too\\nfrequently a presenter gets so obsessed with getting through all of his visual material\\nthat his message gets lost even while all his charts get flipped. As a rule of thumb, I would\\nrecommend four minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid, which can\\ninclude tables, numbers, or graphics. The presenter must highlight whatever he wants\\nto emphasize with a color pen or pointer. Throughout, a presenter has to watch his\\naudience like a hawk. Facial expressions and body language, among other things, will tell\\nhim if people are getting the message, if he needs to stop and go over something again, or\\nif he is boring them and should speed up.\\nThe audience at an operation review also has a crucial part to play. One of the\\ndistinguishing marks of a good meeting is that the audience participates by asking\\nquestions and making comments. If you avoid the presenter’s eyes, yawn, or read the\\nnewspaper it’s worse than not being there at all. Lack of interest undermines the\\nconfidence of the presenter. Remember that you are spending a big part of your working\\nday at the review. Make that time as valuable for yourself and your organization as you\\ncan. Pay attention and jot down things you've heard that you might try. Ask questions if\\nsomething is not clear to you and speak up if you can’t go along with an approach being\\nrecommended. And if a presenter makes a factual error, it is your responsibility to go on\\nrecord. Remember, you are being paid to attend the meeting, which is not meant to bea\\nsiesta in the midst of an otherwise busy day. Regard attendance at the meeting for what\\nit is: work.\\nUnlike a process-oriented meeting, which is a regularly scheduled affair held to\\nexchange knowledge and information, the mission-oriented meeting is usually held ad\\nhoc and is designed to produce a specific output, frequently a decision. The key to\\nsuccess here is what the chairman does, Very often no one is officially given that title, but\\nby whatever name, one person usually has more at stake in the outcome of the meeting\\nthan others. In fact, it is usually the chairman or the de facto chairman who calls the\\nmeeting, and most of what he contributes should occur before it begins. All too often he\\nshows up as if he were just another attendee and hopes that things will develop as he\\nwants. When a mission-oriented meeting fails to accomplish the purpose for which it\\nwas called, the blame belongs to the chairman.\\nThus the chairman must have a clear understanding of the meeting's objective—what\\nneeds to happen and what decision has to be made. The absolute truth is that if you don’t\\nknow what you want, you won't get it. So before calling a meeting, ask yourself: What\\nam [trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a meeting necessary? Or desirable? Or justifiable?\\nDon't call a meeting if all the answers aren't yes.\\nAn estimate of the dollar cost of a manager’s time, including overhead, is about\\n$100 per hour. So a meeting involving ten managers for two hours costs the company\\n$2,000. Most expenditures of $2,000 have to be approved in advance by senior people—\\nlike buying a copying machine or making a transatlantic trip—yet a manager can calla\\nmeeting and commit $2,000 worth of managerial resources at a whim. So even if you're\\njust an invited participant, you should ask yourself if the meeting—and your attendance\\n—is desirable and justified. Tell the chairman—the person who invited you—if you do\\nnot feel it is. Determine the purpose of a meeting before committing your time and\\nyour company’s resources, Get it called off early, at a low-value-added stage, if a meeting\\nmakes no sense, and find a less costly way (a one-on-one meeting, a telephone call, a\\nnote) to pursue the matter.\\nAssuming the meeting does need to be held, the chairman faces a set of obligations.\\nThe first one has to do with attendance. As the chairman, you must identify who should\\nattend and then try to get those people to come. It is not enough to ask people and hope\\nfor the best; you need to follow up and get commitments. If someone invited can't make\\nit himself, see to it that he sends a person with the power to speak for him.\\nKeep in mind that a meeting called to make a specific decision is hard to keep moving\\nif more than six or seven people attend. Eight people should be the absolute cutoff.\\nDecision-making is not a spectator sport, because onlookers get in the way of what needs\\nto be done.\\nThe chairman is also responsible for maintaining discipline. It is criminal for him to\\nallow people to be late and waste everyone's time. Remember, wasting time here really\\nmeans that you are wasting the company’s money, with the meter ticking away at the\\nrate of $100 per hour per person. Do not worry about confronting the late arriver. Just\\nas you would not permit a fellow employee to steal a piece of office equipment worth\\n$2,000, you shouldn't let anyone walk away with the time of his fellow managers.\\nThe chairman should finally be responsible for logistical matters. He should, for\\nexample, make sure that all necessary and audiovisual equipment is present in the\\nmeeting room. He should also send out an agenda that clearly states the purpose of\\nthe meeting, as well as what role everybody there is expected to play to get the desired\\noutput. An example of such an agenda is shown below.\\nTo: Far East Plant Manager\\nCorporate Construction Manager\\nFrom: Far East Construction Manager\\nSubject: Philippines Plant Location Decision\\nFriday, October 1\\n11:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m.\\nSanta Clara Conference Room 212\\nTeleconference connection to Phoenix Conference Room 4\\nPurpose of meeting: To decide specific location for\\nPhilippine plant expansion\\n11:00-11:30 Manufacturing considerations (FE.

It is how we assess our\\nsubordinates’ level of performance and how we deliver\\nthat assessment to them individually. It is also how we\\nallocate the rewards—promotions, dollars, stock\\noptions, or whatever we may use. As we saw earlier,\\nthe review will influence a subordinate’s performance\\n—positively or negatively—for a long time, which\\nmakes the appraisal one of the manager’s highest-\\nleverage activities. In short, the review is an extremely\\npowerful mechanism, and it is little wonder that\\nopinions and feelings about it are strong and diverse.\\nBut what is its fundamental purpose? Though all of\\nthe responses given to my questions are correct, there\\nis one that is more important than any of the others: it\\nis to improve the subordinate’s performance. The\\nreview is usually dedicated to two things: first, the skill\\nlevel of the subordinate, to determine what skills are\\nmissing and to find ways to remedy that lack; and\\nsecond, to intensify the subordinate’s motivation in\\norder to get him on a higher performance curve for the\\nsame skill level (see the illustration on this page).\\nThe review process also represents the most formal\\ntype of institutionalized leadership.

Most jobs involve\\nactivities that are not reflected by output in the time\\nperiod covered by the review. Yet we have to give such\\nactivities appropriate weight as we assess a person’s\\nperformance, even though we know we won't\\nnecessarily be objective, since only output can be\\nmeasured with true objectivity.

The\\nsubordinate’s output during the review period may\\nhave all, some, or nothing to do with his activities\\nduring the same period. Accordingly, the supervisor\\nshould look at the time offset between the activity of\\nthe subordinate and the output that results from that\\nactivity. Let me explain what I mean, because this is\\none lesson I learned the hard way. The organization of\\none of the managers reporting to me had had a superb\\nyear. All output measures were excellent, sales\\nincreased, profit margins were good, the products\\nworked—you could hardly even think of giving\\nanything but a superior review to the person in charge.\\nYet I had some misgivings. Turnover in his group was\\nhigher than it should have been, and his people were\\ngrumbling too much. There were other such straws in\\nthe wind, but who could give credence to elusive signs\\nwhen tangible, measurable performance was so\\noutstanding? So the manager got a very positive\\nThe next year his organization took a nose dive.\\nSales growth disappeared, profitability declined,\\nproduct development was delayed, and the turmoil\\namong his subordinates deepened. As I prepared the\\nnext review of this manager, I struggled to sort out\\nwhat had happened. Did the manager’s performance\\ndeteriorate as suddenly as his organization’s output\\nmeasures indicated? What was going on? I concluded\\nthat in fact the manager’s performance was improving\\nin the second year, even as things seemed to go to hell.\\nThe problem was that his performance had not been\\ngood a year earlier. The output indicators merely\\nrepresented work done years ago—the light from\\ndistant stars, as it were—which was still holding up.\\nThe time offset between the manager’s work and the\\noutput of his organization was just about a year.\\nGreatly embarrassed, I regretfully concluded that the\\nsuperior rating I had given him was totally wrong.\\nTrusting the internal measures, I should have had the\\njudgment and courage to give the manager a much\\nlower rating than I did in spite of the excellent output\\nindicators that did not reflect the year under review.\\nThe time offset between activity and output can also\\nwork the other way around. In the early years of Intel,\\nI was called upon to review the performance of a\\nsubordinate who was setting up a production facility\\nfrom scratch. It had not manufactured anything as yet,\\nbut of course the review could not wait for tangible\\noutput. I had had no prior experience supervising\\nsomeone who did not have a record of concrete output.\\nHere I gave my subordinate credit for doing well, even\\nthough output remained uncertain. As managers, we\\nare really called upon to judge performance, not just to\\nsee and record it when it’s in plain sight.\\nFinally, as you review a manager, should you be\\njudging his performance or the performance of the\\ngroup under his supervision? You should be doing\\nboth. Ultimately what you are after is the performance\\nof the group, but the manager is there to add value in\\nsome way. You need to determine what that is. You\\nmust ask: Is he doing anything with his group? Is he\\nhiring new people? Is he training the people he has,\\nand doing other things that are likely to improve the\\noutput of the team in the future? The most difficult\\nissues in determining a professional’s performance\\nwill be based on asking questions and making\\njudgments of this sort.\\nOne big pitfall to be avoided is the “potential trap.”\\nAt all times you should force yourself to assess\\nperformance, not potential. By “potential” I mean form\\nrather than substance. I was once asked to approve the\\nperformance review of a general manager whose\\nsupervisor rated him highly for the year. The manager\\nwas responsible for a business unit that lost money,\\nmissed its revenue forecast month after month,\\nslipped engineering schedules, and in general showed\\npoor output and internal measures over the year.\\nAccordingly, I could not approve the review.\\nWhereupon his supervisor said, “But he is an\\noutstanding general manager. He is knowledgeable\\nand handles himself well. It’s his organization that did\\nnot do well, not the manager himself!” This cut no ice\\nwith me because the performance rating of a\\nmanager cannot be higher than the one we would\\naccord to his organization! It is very important to\\nassess actual performance, not appearances; real\\noutput, not good form. Had the manager been given a\\nhigh rating, Intel would have signaled to all at the\\ncompany that to do well, you must “act” like a good\\nmanager, talk like one, and emulate one—but you\\ndon’t need to perform like one.\\nA decision to promote is often linked, as it should\\nbe, to the performance review. We must recognize that\\nno action communicates a manager’s values to an\\norganization more clearly and loudly than his choice of\\nwhom he promotes. By elevating someone, we are, in\\neffect, creating role models for others in our\\norganization. The old saying has it that when we\\npromote our best salesman and make him a manager,\\nwe ruin a good salesman and get a bad manager. But if\\nwe think about it, we see we have no choice but to\\npromote the good salesman. Should our worst\\nsalesman get the job? When we promote our best, we\\nare saying to our subordinates that performance is\\nIt is hard enough for us to assess our subordinates’\\nperformance, but we must also try to improve it. No\\nmatter how well a subordinate has done his job, we\\ncan always find ways to suggest improvement,\\nsomething about which a manager need not feel\\nembarrassed. Blessed with 20/20 hindsight, we can\\ncompare what the subordinate did against what he\\nmight have done, and the variance can tell both of us\\nhow to do things better in the future.\\nDelivering the Assessment\\nThere are three L’s to keep in mind when delivering a\\nreview: Level, listen, and leave yourself out.\\nYou must level with your _ subordinate—the\\ncredibility and integrity of the entire system depend on\\nyour being totally frank. And don’t be surprised to find\\nthat praising someone in a straightforward fashion can\\nbe just as hard as criticizing him without\\nThe word “listen” has special meaning here. The aim\\nof communication is to transmit thoughts from the\\nbrain of person A to the brain of person B. Thoughts in\\nthe head of A are first converted into words, which are\\nenunciated and via sound waves reach the ear of B; as\\nnerve impulses they travel to his brain, where they are\\ntransformed back into thoughts and presumably kept.\\nShould person A use a tape recorder to confirm the\\nwords used in the review? The answer is an emphatic\\nno. Words themselves are nothing but a means;\\ngetting the right thought communicated is the end.\\nPerhaps B has become so emotional that he can’t\\nunderstand something that would be perfectly clear to\\nanyone else. Perhaps B has become so preoccupied\\ntrying to formulate answers that he can’t really listen\\nand get A’s message. Perhaps B has tuned out and as a\\ndefense is thinking of going fishing. All of these\\npossibilities can and do occur, and all the more so\\nwhen A’s message is laden with conflict.\\nHow then can you be sure you are being truly heard?\\nWhat techniques can you employ? Is it enough to have\\nyour subordinate paraphrase your words? I don’t think\\nso. What you must do is employ all of your sensory\\ncapabilities. To make sure you're being heard, you\\nshould watch the person you are talking to.\\nRemember, the more complex the issue, the more\\nprone communication is to being lost. Does your\\nsubordinate give appropriate responses to what you\\nare saying? Does he allow himself to receive your\\nmessage? If his responses—verbal and nonverbal—do\\nnot completely assure you that what you’ve said has\\ngotten through, it is your responsibility to keep at it\\nuntil you are satisfied that you have been heard and\\nThis is what I mean by listening: employing your\\nentire arsenal of sensory capabilities to make certain\\nyour points are being properly interpreted by your\\nsubordinate’s brain. All the intelligence and good faith\\nused to prepare your review will produce nothing\\nunless this occurs. Your tool, to say it again, is total\\nEvery good classroom teacher works in the same\\nway. He knows when what he is saying is being\\nunderstood by his students. If it isn’t, he takes heed\\nand explains things again or explains things in a\\ndifferent way. All of us have had professors who\\nlectured by looking at the blackboard, mumbling to it,\\nand carefully avoiding direct eye contact with the class.\\nThe reason: knowing that their presentation was\\nmurky and incomprehensible, these teachers looked\\naway from their audience to avoid confirming visually\\nwhat they already knew. So don’t imitate your worst\\nprofessors while delivering performance reviews.\\nListen with all your might to make sure your\\nsubordinate is receiving your message, and don’t stop\\ndelivering it until you are satisfied that he is.\\nThe third L is “leave yourself out.” It is very\\nimportant for you to understand that the performance\\nreview is about and for your subordinate. So your own\\ninsecurities, anxieties, guilt, or whatever should be\\nkept out of it. At issue are the subordinate’s problems,\\nnot the supervisor’s, and it is the subordinate’s day in\\ncourt. Anyone called upon to assess the performance\\nof another person is likely to have strong emotions\\nbefore and during the review, just as actors have stage\\nfright. You should work to control these emotions so\\nthat they don’t affect your task, though they will well\\nup no matter how many reviews you've given.\\nLet us now consider three types of performance\\n“On the One Hand...On the Other Hand...”\\nMost reviews probably fall into this category,\\ncontaining both positive and negative assessments.\\nCommon problems here include superficiality, clichés,\\nand laundry lists of unrelated observations. All of\\nthese will leave your subordinate bewildered and will\\nhardly improve his future performance, the review’s\\nbasic purpose. Let me suggest some ways to help you\\ndeliver this type of review.\\nThe key is to recognize that your subordinate, like\\nmost people, has only a finite capacity to deal with\\nfacts, issues, and suggestions. You may possess seven\\ntruths about his performance, but if his capacity is\\nonly four, at best you'll waste your breath on the other\\nthree. At worst you will have left him with a case of\\nsensory overload, and he will go away without getting\\nanything out of the review. The fact is that a person\\ncan only absorb so many messages at one time,\\nespecially when they deal with his own performance.\\nThe purpose of the review is not to cleanse your\\nsystem of all the truths you may have observed about\\nyour subordinate, but to improve his performance. So\\nhere less may very well be more.\\nHow can you target a few key areas? First, consider\\nas many aspects of your subordinate’s performance as\\npossible. You should scan material such as progress\\nreports, performance against quarterly objectives, and\\none-on-one meeting notes. Then sit down with a blank\\npiece of paper. As you consider your subordinate’s\\nperformance, write everything down on the paper. Do\\nnot edit in your head. Get everything down, knowing\\nthat doing so doesn’t commit you to do anything.\\nThings major, minor, and trivial can be included in no\\nparticular order. When you have run out of items, you\\ncan put all of your supporting documentation away.\\nNow, from your worksheet, look for relationships\\nbetween the various items listed. You will probably\\nbegin to notice that certain items are different\\nmanifestations of the same phenomenon, and that\\nthere may be some indications why a certain strength\\nor weakness exists. When you find such relationships,\\nyou can start calling them “messages” for the\\nsubordinate. At this point, your worksheet might look\\nsomething like that shown on the next page. Now,\\nagain from your worksheet, begin to draw conclusions\\nand specific examples to support them. Once your list\\nof messages has been compiled, ask yourself if your\\nsubordinate will be able to remember all of the\\nmessages you have chosen to deliver. If not, you must\\ndelete the less important ones. Remember, what you\\ncouldn’t include in this review, you can probably take\\nup in the next one.\\n— spec process:\\n— poor kick-off\\nfor spec training\\nae on cotter\\n— snf liste\\\\tofpeers\\n1.

If you have discharged\\nresponsibilities | adequately\\nthroughout the year, holding regular one-on-one\\nmeetings and providing guidance when needed, there\\nshould never be any surprises at a performance review,\\nright? Wrong. When you are using the worksheet,\\nsometimes you come up with a message that will\\nstartle you. So what do you do? You're faced with\\neither delivering the message or not, but if the purpose\\nof the review is to improve your subordinate’s\\nperformance, you must deliver it. Preferably, a review\\nshould not contain any surprises, but if you uncover\\none, swallow hard and bring it up.\\nOn this page you'll find an “on the one hand, on the\\nother hand” kind of performance review. It was written\\nto correspond to the worksheet shown opposite. I have\\nannotated it to call attention to some of the things we\\ndiscussed in this chapter.\\nWith a little soul-searching, you may come to realize\\nthat you have a major performance problem on your\\nhands. You have a subordinate who, unless turned\\naround, could get fired. To deal with the problem, you\\nand your subordinate will likely go through stages\\ncommonly experienced in problem-solving of all kinds\\nand particularly in conflict resolution. These are\\nshown on this page. You'll find these occurring\\ndefinitely during and possibly after the “blast” review,\\nwhich is basically an exercise of resolving conflict\\nabout a big performance problem.\\nA poor performer has a strong tendency to ignore\\nhis problem. Here a manager needs facts and\\nexamples so that he can demonstrate its reality.\\nProgress of some sort is made when the subordinate\\nactively denies the existence of a problem rather than\\nignoring it passively, as before. Evidence can overcome\\nresistance here as well, and we enter the third stage,\\nwhen the subordinate admits that there is a problem,\\nbut maintains it is not his problem. Instead he will\\nblame others, a standard defense mechanism. Using\\nthis defense, he can continue to avoid the\\nresponsibility and burden of remedying the situation.\\nThese three steps usually follow one another in fairly\\nrapid succession. But things tend to get stuck at the\\nblame-others stage. If your subordinate does have a\\nproblem, there’s no way of resolving it if he continues\\nto blame it on others. He has to take the biggest step:\\nnamely assuming responsibility. He has to say not\\nonly that there is a problem but that it is his problem.\\nThis is fateful, because it means work: “If it is my\\nproblem, I have to do something about it. If I have to\\ndo something, it is likely to be unpleasant and will\\ndefinitely mean a lot of work on my part.” Once\\nresponsibility has been assumed, however, finding the\\nsolution is relatively easy. This is because the move\\nfrom blaming others to assuming responsibility\\nconstitutes an emotional step, while the move from\\nassuming responsibility to finding the solution is an\\nintellectual one, and the latter is easier.\\nThe stages of problem-solving: The\\ntransition from blaming others to\\nassuming responsibility is an\\nIt is the reviewer’s job to get the subordinate to\\nmove through all of the stages to that of assuming\\nresponsibility, though finding the solution should be a\\nshared task. The supervisor should keep track of what\\nstage things are in. If the supervisor wants to go on to\\nfind the solution when the subordinate is still denying\\nor blaming others, nothing can happen. Knowing\\nwhere you are will help you both move through the\\nIn the end, there are three possible outcomes. One,\\nthe subordinate accepts your assessment and your\\nrecommended cure, and commits himself to take it.\\nTwo, he may disagree completely with your\\nassessment but still accepts your cure. Three, the\\nsubordinate disagrees with your assessment and does\\nnot commit himself to do what you’ve recommended.\\nAs the supervisor, which of these three should you\\nconsider acceptable resolutions to the problem?\\nI feel very strongly that any outcome that includes a\\ncommitment to action is acceptable. Complex issues\\ndo not lend themselves easily to universal agreement.\\nIf your subordinate says he’s committed to change\\nthings, you have to assume he’s sincere. The key word\\nhere is acceptable. It is certainly more desirable for\\nyou and your subordinate to agree about the problem\\nand the solution, because that will make you feel that\\nhe will enthusiastically work toward remedying it. So\\nup to a point you should try to get your subordinate to\\nagree with you. But if you can’t, accept his\\ncommitment to change and go on. Don’t confuse\\nemotional comfort with operational need. To make\\nthings work, people do not need to side with you; you\\nonly need them to commit themselves to pursue a\\ncourse of action that has been decided upon. There\\nseems to be something not quite nice about expecting\\na person to walk down a path he’d rather not be on.\\nBut on the job we are after a person’s performance, not\\nour psychological comfort.\\nI learned the distinction between the two during one\\nof the first reviews I had to give. I was trying very hard\\nto persuade my subordinate to see things my way. He\\nsimply would not go along with me and finally said to\\nme, “Andy, you will never convince me, but why do\\nyou insist on wanting to convince me? I’ve already said\\nI will do what you say.” I shut up, embarrassed, not\\nknowing why. It took me a long time before I realized I\\nwas embarrassed because my insistence had a lot to do\\nwith making me feel better and little to do with the\\nrunning of the business.\\nIf it becomes clear that you are not going to get your\\nsubordinate past the blame-others stage, you will have\\nto assume the formal role of the supervisor, endowed\\nwith position power, and say, “This is what I, as your\\nboss, am instructing you to do. I understand that you\\ndo not see it my way. You may be right or I may be\\nright. But I am not only empowered, I am required by\\nthe organization for which we both work to give you\\ninstructions, and this is what I want you to do...” And\\nproceed to secure your subordinate’s commitment to\\nthe course of action you want and thereafter monitor\\nhis performance against that commitment.\\nRecently one of my subordinates wrote a review that\\nI considered superficial, lacking analysis and depth.\\nMy subordinate, after some discussion, agreed with\\nmy assessment, but he considered the issue not\\nimportant enough, as he put it, to spend time rewriting\\nthe review. After more spirited discussion, we\\nremained deadlocked. Finally, I took a deep breath\\nand said to him, “Look, I understand that you don’t\\nconsider it worth your time to do it. But I want you to\\ndo it.” I added that “I guess there is a basic difference\\nbetween us. The integrity of the performance review\\nsystem is just more important to me than it is to you.\\nThat is why I have to insist.” He looked back at me and\\nafter a moment simply said, “Okay.” He thought I was\\nout in left field and resented the fact that I made him\\nspend time on _ something he thought was\\nunimportant, but he committed himself to redo the\\nreview, and, in fact, he did it well. His subordinate\\nended up getting the reworked, much more thorough\\nand thoughtful review, and the fact that his review was\\nrewritten without the agreement of my subordinate\\nmade no difference to him.\\nReviewing the Ace\\nAfter trying to establish the principles of performance\\nappraisal with a group of about twenty middle\\nmanagers, I asked them to take a review they had once\\nreceived and to analyze it according to our new\\ncriteria. The results were not what I expected, but I did\\nlearn from them.\\nThis group consisted of achievers, and their ratings\\nwere mostly very high. The reviews were exceptionally\\nwell written, much better than the average at Intel.\\nHowever, for content, they tended to be retrospective\\nassessments, analyses of what the subordinate had\\ndone in the course of the prior year. Even though their\\nkey purpose was to improve the subordinate’s future\\nperformance, a majority of the reviews made little or\\nno attempt to define what the subordinate needed to\\ndo to improve his performance or even to maintain his\\ncurrent level. It seems that for an achiever the\\nsupervisor’s effort goes into determining and justifying\\nthe judgment of the superior performance, while\\ngiving little attention to how he could do even better.\\nBut for a poor performer, the supervisor tends to\\nconcentrate heavily on ways he can improve\\nperformance, providing detailed and_ elaborate\\n“corrective action programs,” step-by-step affairs\\nmeant to ensure that the marginal employee can pull\\nhimself up to meet minimum requirements.\\nI think we have our priorities reversed. Shouldn’t we\\nspend more time trying to improve the performance of\\nour stars? After all, these people account for a\\ndisproportionately large share of the work in any\\norganization. Put another way, concentrating on the\\nstars is a high-leverage activity: if they get better, the\\nimpact on group output is very great indeed.\\nWe all have a hard time saying things that are\\ncritical, whether we’re talking to a superior employee\\nor a marginal one. We must keep in mind, however,\\nthat no matter how stellar a person’s performance\\nlevel is, there is always room for improvement. Don’t\\nhesitate to use the 20/20 hindsight provided by the\\nreview to show anyone, even an ace, how he might\\nhave done better.\\nOther Thoughts and Practices\\nIs it a good idea to ask the subordinate to prepare\\nsome kind of a self-review before being reviewed by\\nhis supervisor? Let me answer the question this way.\\nYour own review is obviously important to you, and\\nyou really want to know how your supervisor sees your\\nyear’s work. If you prepare a review and give it to your\\nsupervisor, and he simply changes the format, retypes\\nit, gives you a superior rating, and then hands it back\\nto you, how will you feel? Probably cheated. If you\\nhave to tell your’ supervisor about your\\naccomplishments, he obviously doesn’t pay much\\nattention to what you are doing. Reviewing the\\nperformance of subordinates is a formal act of\\nleadership. If supervisors permit themselves to be\\nprompted in one way or another, their leadership and\\ntheir capacity for it will begin to appear false. So the\\nintegrity of the supervisors’ judgment here must be\\npreserved at all costs, and they must commit\\nthemselves through an up-front judgment of their\\nsubordinates’ performance if the health and vitality of\\nthe review process are to be maintained.\\nWhat about asking your subordinate to evaluate\\nyour performance as his supervisor? I think this might\\nbe a good idea. But you should make it clear to your\\nsubordinate that it’s your job to assess his\\nperformance, while his assessment of you has only\\nadvisory status. The point is, he is not your leader; you\\nare his. And under no circumstances should you\\npretend that you and your subordinates are equal\\nduring performance reviews.\\nShould you deliver the written review before,\\nduring, or after the face-to-face discussion? I have\\ntried it all three ways. Let’s consider some of the pros\\nand cons of each. What happens if you have the review\\nfirst and then give your subordinate what you’ve\\nwritten later? Upon reading it, the subordinate may\\nfind a phrase that he didn’t “hear” earlier and blow up\\nover it. What about delivering the written review\\nduring the discussion? One manager told me that he\\ngives the subordinate a copy of the review and tells\\nhim to read the first several paragraphs, which they\\nthen discuss. Grouping the paragraphs, supervisor and\\nsubordinate work their way through the appraisal. I\\ncan see a problem with this. How can a supervisor ask\\na subordinate to stop at paragraph three when he is so\\neager to read the rest of what he’s got? Another\\nmanager told me that he reads the written review to\\nhis subordinate to try to control the session. But here,\\ntoo, the subordinate is left eager to know what comes\\nnext and might not pay attention to what is really\\nbeing said. Also, when your subordinate is given a\\nwritten review during the discussion, he won’t have\\nthe time to think about what it says and is likely to\\nwalk away muttering to himself, “I should have said\\nthis in response, and I should have said that.” For a\\ngood meeting of minds, your subordinate should have\\ntime to work out his reactions to what’s in the review.\\nIn my experience, the best thing to do is to give your\\nsubordinate the written review sometime before the\\nface-to-face discussion. He can then read the whole\\nthing privately and digest it. He can react or overreact\\nand then look at the “messages” again. By the time the\\ntwo of you get together, he will be much more\\nprepared, both emotionally and rationally.\\nPreparing and delivering a performance assessment\\nis one of the hardest tasks you'll have to perform as a\\nmanager. The best way to learn how to do one is to\\nthink critically about the reviews you yourself have\\nreceived. And if you’ve been lucky, the tradition of\\ngood performance reviews has been handed from\\nsupervisor to subordinate, which has helped to\\nmaintain the integrity of the system in your company.\\nNevertheless, people constantly need to be prodded\\ninto doing a good job of reviewing. Each year I read\\nsomething like a hundred evaluations, all of those\\nwritten by my own subordinates and a random\\nselection from throughout Intel. I comment on them\\nand send them back for rewrites or with a\\ncomplimentary note. I do this with as much noise and\\nvisibility as I can, because I want to reiterate and\\nreaffirm the significance the system has and should\\nhave for every Intel employee. Anything less would not\\nbe appropriate for the most important kind of task-\\nrelevant feedback we can give our subordinates.\\nEXEMPT PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL\\nNAME_John Doe JOB TITLE.

              " Document(page_content='The Breakfast Factory\\nThe Basics of Production:\\nDelivering a Breakfast\\n(or a College Graduate, or a Compiler, or a Convicted Criminal...)\\nThe Three-Minute Egg\\nTo understand the principles of production, imagine that you\\'re a waiter, which I was\\nwhile I went to college, and that your task is to serve a breakfast consisting of a three-\\nminute soft-boiled egg, buttered toast, and coffee. Your job is to prepare and deliver the\\nthree items simultaneously, each of them fresh and hot.\\nThe task here encompasses the basic requirements of production. These are to build\\nand deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery\\ntime, at an acceptable quality level, and at the lowest possible cost. Production’s charter\\ncannot be to deliver whatever the customer wants whenever he wants it, for this would\\nrequire an infinite production capacity or the equivalent—very large, ready-to-deliver\\ninventories. In our example, the customer may want to have a perfect three-minute egg\\nwith hot buttered toast and steaming coffee waiting for him the moment he sits down.\\nTo fulfill such an expectation, you would either have to have your kitchen idle and poised\\nto serve the customer whenever he drops in, or have a ready-to-consume inventory of\\nperfectly boiled eggs, hot buttered toast, and coffee. Neither is practical.\\nInstead, a manufacturer should accept the responsibility of delivering a product at\\nthe time committed to—in this case, by implication, about five to ten minutes after the\\ncustomer arrives at our breakfast establishment. And we must make our breakfast at a\\ncost that enables us to sell it at a competitive price and still make an acceptable profit.\\nHow are we going to do this in the most intelligent way? We start by looking at our\\nThe first thing we must do is to pin down the step in the flow that will determine the\\noverall shape of our operation, which we\\'ll call the limiting step. The issue here is simple:\\nwhich of the breakfast components takes the longest to prepare? Because the coffee is\\nalready steaming in the kitchen and the toast takes only about a minute, the answer is\\nobviously the egg, so we should plan the entire job around the time needed to boil it. Not\\nonly does that component take the longest to prepare, the egg is also for most customers\\nthe most important feature of the breakfast.\\nWhat must happen is illustrated opposite. To work back from the time of delivery,\\nyou\\'ll need to calculate the time required to prepare the three components to ensure that\\nthey are all ready simultaneously. First you must allow time to assemble the items on a\\ntray. Next you must get the toast from the toaster and the coffee from the pot, as well as\\nthe egg out of the boiling water, Adding the required time to do this to the time needed\\nto get and cook the egg defines the length of the entire process—called, in production\\njargon, the total throughput time.\\nNow you come to the toast. Using the egg time as your base, you must allow yourself\\ntime to get and toast the slices of bread. Finally, using the toast time as your base, you\\ncan determine when you need to pour the coffee. The key idea is that we construct our\\nproduction flow by starting with the longest (or most difficult, or most sensitive, or most\\nexpensive) step and work our way back. Notice when each of the three steps began and\\nended. We planned our flow around the most critical step—the time required to boil the\\nege—and we staggered each of the other steps according to individual throughput times;\\nagain in production jargon, we offset them from each other.\\n(Customer Order) Deliver\\nMaking the eggs is the limiting step.\\nThe idea of a limiting step has very broad applicability. Take, for example, the need to\\nrecruit college graduates to work for Intel. Certain of our managers visit the colleges,\\ninterview some of the seniors, and invite the more promising candidates to visit the\\ncompany. We bear the expense of the candidates’ trip, which can be considerable. During\\nthe trip, the students are closely interviewed by other managers and technical people.\\nAfter due consideration, employment is offered to some of the students whose skills and\\ncapabilities match our needs best, and those who accept the offers eventually come to\\nwork for the company.\\nTo apply the basic principle of production, you need to build the sequence here around\\nits most expensive feature, which is the students’ trip to the plant, thanks to the cost\\nof travel and the time that Intel managers spend with the candidates. To minimize the\\nuse of this step per final college hire, we obviously have to increase the ratio of accepted\\noffers to applicants invited to visit the plant, which we do by using phone interviews\\nto screen people before issuing invitations. The technique saves money, substantially\\nincreases the ratio of offers extended per plant visit, and reduces the need to use the\\nexpensive limiting step per hire.\\nThe principle of time offsets is also present here. Working back from the time the\\nstudents will graduate, the recruiter staggers the various steps involved to allow time for\\neverything—on-campus interviews, phone screening, plant visits—to take place at the\\nappropriate times during the months preceding graduation.\\nOther production principles underlie the preparation of our breakfast. In the making\\nof it, we find present the three fundamental types of production operations: process\\nmanufacturing, an activity that physically or chemically changes material just as boiling\\nchanges an egg; assembly, in which components are put together to constitute a new\\nentity just as the egg, the toast, and the coffee together make a breakfast; and test, which\\nsubjects the components or the total to an examination of its characteristics. There are,\\nfor example, visual tests made at points in the breakfast production process: you can see\\nthat the coffee is steaming and that the toast is brown.\\nProcess, assembly, and test operations can be readily applied to other very different\\nkinds of productive work. Take, for instance, the task of training a sales force to sell\\na new product. The three types of production operations can be easily identified. The\\nconversion of large amounts of raw data about the product into meaningful selling\\nstrategies comprehensible to the sales personnel is a process step, which transforms data\\ninto strategies. The combination of the various sales strategies into a coherent program\\ncan be compared to an assembly step. Here the appropriate product-selling strategies\\nand pertinent market data (such as competitive pricing and availability) are made to\\nflow into one presentation, along with such things as brochures, handouts, and flip\\ncharts. The test operation comes in the form of a “dry run” presentation with a selected\\ngroup of field sales personnel and field sales management. [f the dry run fails the test, the\\nmaterial must be “reworked” (another well-established manufacturing concept) to meet\\nthe concerns and objections of the test audience.\\nThe development of a “compiler,” a major piece of computer software, also\\ndemonstrates process, assembly, and test. A computer understands and uses human\\ninstruction only if it receives such instruction in its own language. A compiler is an\\ninterpreter, enabling the computer to translate into its language material written in\\nterms and phrases resembling English. With a compiler, a programmer can think more\\nor less like a human being rather than having to adapt himself to the way the computer\\nprocesses information. The task of getting a machine to interpret and translate in this\\nfashion is obviously formidable; thus the development of a compiler takes strenuous\\neffort on the part of skilled and gifted software engineers. The effort, however, is justified\\nby the simplification it brings to computer use.\\nIn any case, the development of the individual pieces out of which a compiler is\\nbuilt represents a series of processing steps. Actual working pieces of software are\\ngenerated out of specifications and basic design know-how. Each piece then undergoes\\nan individual operation called a “unit test.” When one fails, the defective portion of\\nthe software is returned to the process phase for “rework.” After all the pieces pass\\ntheir respective unit tests, they are assembled to form the compiler. Then, of course, a\\n“system test” is performed on the complete product before it is shipped to the customer.\\nTime offsets are used extensively in the task. Because throughput times for the various\\nengineering steps are well established, the timing of the releases of various bodies of\\nsoftware from one stage to another can all be calculated and staged in advance.\\nBreakfast preparation, college recruiting, sales training, and compiler design are very\\nmuch unlike one another, but all of them possess a basically similar flow of activity to\\nproduce a specific output.\\nA Few Complications\\nReal life, as you know, is full of thickets and underbrush. In a schematic flow chart, our\\nbreakfast operation assumed infinite capacity, meaning that nobody had to wait for an\\navailable toaster or for a pot to boil an egg in. But no such ideal world exists. What would\\nhappen if you had to stand in a line of waiters, waiting for your turn to use the toaster? If\\nyou didn’t adjust your production flow to account for the queue, your three-minute egg\\ncould easily become a six-minute egg. So limited toaster capacity means you have to redo\\nyour flow around the new limiting step. The egg still determines the overall quality of\\nthe breakfast, but your time offsets must be altered.\\nHow would our model reflect the change in manufacturing flow? Working back from\\nthe time of breakfast delivery, let’s see how the production is affected, as illustrated\\nopposite, The egg cycle remains the same, as does the one for coffee. But limited toaster\\ncapacity makes for quite a difference. Now you must account for the delivery time of the\\ntoast and the wait for a free toaster. This means the whole production process has to be\\nconceived differently. Toaster capacity has become the limiting step, and what you do\\nhas to be reworked around it.\\n(Customer Order) Deliver\\nget wait for\\nWith limited toaster capacity, making the toast becomes the limiting step.\\nNow let’s complicate things a little further. What happens if you are stuck in line\\nwaiting for a toaster when it’s time to start boiling your egg? Your conflict is seemingly\\nirreconcilable, but it really isn’t. If you were managing the restaurant, you could turn\\nyour personnel into specialists by hiring one egg-cooker, one toast-maker, one coffee-\\npourer, and one person to supervise the operation. But that, of course, creates an\\nimmense amount of overhead, probably making it too expensive to consider.\\nIf you were a waiter, you could ask the waiter in line next to you to help out—to\\nput your toast in while you ran off to start your egg. But when you have to depend on\\nsomeone else, the results are likely to be less predictable. As the manager, you could add\\nanother toaster, but this becomes an expensive addition of capital equipment. You could\\nrun the toaster continuously and build up an inventory of hot toast, throwing away what\\nyou can\\'t use but always having immediate access to product. That means waste, which\\ncan also become too expensive for the operation. But at least you know that alternatives\\ndo exist: equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each\\nother and then balanced against delivery time.\\nBecause each alternative costs money, your task is to find the most cost-effective way to\\ndeploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work. Bear in mind\\nthat in this and in other such situations there is a right answer, the one that can give you\\nthe best delivery time and product quality at the lowest possible cost. To find that right\\nanswer, you must develop a clear understanding of the trade-offs between the various\\nfactors—manpower, capacity, and inventory—and you must reduce the understanding\\nto a quantifiable set of relationships. You probably won\\'t use a stopwatch to conduct\\na time-and-motion study of the person behind a toaster; nor will you calculate the\\nprecise trade-off between the cost of toast inventory and the added toaster capacity in\\nmathematical terms. What is important is the thinking you force yourself to go through\\nto understand the relationship between the various aspects of your production process.\\nLet’s take our manufacturing example a step further and turn our business into a\\nhigh-volume breakfast factory operation. First, you buy a continuous egg-boiler that will\\nproduce a constant supply of perfectly boiled three-minute eggs. It will look something\\nlike what’s drawn in the figure opposite. Note that our business now assumes a high and\\npredictable demand for three-minute eggs; it cannot now readily provide a four-minute\\negg, because automated equipment is not very flexible. Second, you match the output\\nof the continuous egg-boiler with the output of a continuous toaster, as specialized\\npersonnel load each piece of equipment and deliver the product. We have now turned\\nthings into a continuous operation at the expense of flexibility, and we can no longer\\nprepare each customer\\'s order exactly when and how he requests it. So our customers\\nhave to adjust their expectations if they want to enjoy the benefits of our new mode:\\nlower cost and more predictable product quality.\\nSe EEE ial a\\nThe continuous egg-boiler; a constant supply of three-minute eggs.\\nBut continuous operation does not automatically mean lower cost and better quality.\\nWhat would happen if the water temperature in the continuous egg-boiler quietly went\\nout of specification? The entire work-in-process—all the eggs in the boiler—and the\\noutput of the machine from the time the temperature climbed or dropped to the time\\nthe malfunction was discovered becomes unusable. All the toast is also wasted because\\nyou don’t have any eggs to serve with it. How do you minimize the risk of a breakdown\\nof this sort? Performing a functional test is one way. From time to time you open an\\negg as it comes out of the machine and check its quality. But you will have to throw\\naway the ege tested. A second way involves in-process inspection, which can take many\\nforms. You could, for example, simply insert a thermometer into the water so that the\\ntemperature could be easily and frequently checked. To avoid having to pay someone to\\nread the thermometer, you could connect an electronic gadget to it that would set off\\nbells anytime the temperature varied by a degree or two. The point is that whenever\\npossible, you should choose in-process tests over those that destroy product.\\nWhat else could go wrong with our continuous egg-machine? The eggs going into it\\ncould be cracked or rotten, or they could be over- or undersized, which would affect how\\nfast they cook. To avoid such problems, you will want to look at the eggs at the time of\\nreceipt, something called incoming or receiving inspection. If the eggs are unacceptable\\nin some way, you are going to have to send them back, leaving you with none. Now\\nyou have to shut down. To avoid that, you need a raw material inventory. But how large\\nshould it be? The principle to be applied here is that you should have enough to cover\\nyour consumption rate for the length of time it takes to replace your raw material. That\\nmeans if your egg man comes by and delivers once a day, you want to keep a day’s worth\\nof inventory on hand to protect yourself. But remember, inventory costs money, so you\\nhave to weigh the advantage of carrying a day’s supply against the cost of carrying it.\\nBesides the cost of the raw material and the cost of money, you should also try to gauge\\nthe opportunity at risk: what would it cost if you had to shut your egg machine down for\\naday? How many customers would you lose? How much would it cost to lure them back?\\nSuch questions define the opportunity at risk.\\nAll production flows have a basic characteristic: the material becomes more valuable\\nas it moves through the process. A boiled egg is more valuable than a raw one, a\\nfully assembled breakfast is more valuable than its constituent parts, and finally, the\\nbreakfast placed in front of the customer is more valuable still. The last carries the\\nperceived value the customer associates with the establishment when he drives into the\\nparking lot after seeing the sign “Andy\\'s Better Breakfasts.” Similarly, a finished compiler\\nis more valuable than the constituent parts of semantic analysis, code generation, and\\nrun time, and a college graduate to whom we are ready to extend an employment offer is\\nmore valuable to us than the college student we meet on campus for the first time.\\nA common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a\\nproduction process at the lowest-value stage possible. Thus, we should find and reject the\\nrotten egg as it’s being delivered from our supplier rather than permitting the customer\\nto find it. Likewise, if we can decide that we don’t want a college candidate at the time of\\nthe campus interview rather than during the course of a plant visit, we save the cost of\\nthe trip and the time of both the candidate and the interviewers. And we should also try\\nto find any performance problem at the time of the unit test of the pieces that make upa\\ncompiler rather than in the course of the test of the final product itself.\\nFinally, at the risk of being considered hard-hearted, let\\'s examine the criminal\\njustice system as if it were a production process aimed at finding criminals and putting\\nthem into jail. The production begins when a crime is reported to the police and the\\npolice respond. In many instances, after some questions are asked, no further action\\ncan be taken. For those crimes which the police can pursue, the second step is more\\ninvestigation. But the case often ends here for lack of evidence, complaints being\\ndropped, and so on. If things move to the next stage, a suspect is arrested, and the\\npolice try to find witnesses and build a case, hoping to get an indictment. Once again,\\nan indictment is often not returned because of insufficient evidence. For the cases that\\nactually do go ahead, the next stage is trial. Sometimes the suspect is found not guilty;\\nsometimes the case is dismissed. But when a conviction is secured, the process moves to\\nthe sentencing and appeals round. At times a person found guilty of a crime will be given\\na suspended sentence and probation, and at others the conviction will be overturned on\\nappeal. For the small fraction that remains, the final stage is jail.\\nIf we make some reasoned assumptions about the percentages that move forward at\\neach stage and the costs associated with each, we arrive at some striking conclusions. If\\nwe compile the cost of the effort that goes into securing a conviction and assign it only\\nto those criminals who actually end up in jail, we find that the cost of a single conviction\\nworks out to be well over a million dollars—an absolutely staggering sum. The number\\nis so high, of course, because only a very small percentage of the flow of accused persons\\nmakes it all the way through the process. Everyone knows that prisons are overcrowded,\\nand that many criminals end up serving shorter jail terms or no jail terms at all because\\ncells are in such short supply. So a terribly expensive trade-off results, violating the most\\nimportant production principles. The limiting step here should clearly be obtaining a\\nconviction. The construction cost of a jail cell even today is only some $80,000. This, plus\\nthe $10-20,000 it costs to keep a person in jail for a year, is a small amount compared to\\nthe million dollars required to secure a conviction. Not to jail a criminal in whom society\\nhas invested over a million dollars for lack of an $80,000 jail cell clearly misuses society\\'s\\ntotal investment in the criminal justice system. And this happens because we permit the\\nwrong step (the availability of jail cells) to limit the overall process.\\nManaging the Breakfast Factory\\nIndicators as a Key Tool\\nA hungry public has loved the breakfast you’ve been serving, and thanks to the help of\\nyour many customers and a friendly banker, you\\'ve created a breakfast factory, which\\namong other things uses specialized production lines for toast, coffee, and eggs. As\\nmanager of the factory, you have a substantial staff and a lot of automated equipment.\\nLet’s say that as manager of the breakfast factory, you will work with five indicators to\\nmeet your production goals on a daily basis. Which five would they be? Put another way,\\nwhich five pieces of information would you want to look at each day, immediately upon\\narriving at your office?\\nHere are my candidates. First, you\\'ll want to know your sales forecast for the day. How\\nmany breakfasts should you plan to deliver? To assess how much confidence you should\\nplace in your forecast, you would want to know how many you delivered yesterday\\ncompared to how many you planned on delivering—in other words, the variance\\nbetween your plan and the actual delivery of breakfasts for the preceding day.\\nYour next key indicator is raw material inventory. Do you have enough eggs, bread,\\nand coffee on hand to keep your factory running today? If you find you have too little\\ninventory, you can still order more. If you find you have too much, you may want to\\ncancel today’s egg delivery.\\nAnother important piece of information is the condition of your equipment. If\\nanything broke down yesterday, you will want to get it repaired or rearrange your\\nproduction line to meet your forecast for the day.\\nYou also must get a fix on your manpower. If two waiters are out sick, you will have\\nto come up with something if you are still going to meet the demand forecasted. Should\\nyou call in temporary help? Should you take someone off the toaster line and make him\\nFinally, you want to have some kind of quality indicator. It is not enough to monitor\\nthe number of breakfasts each waiter delivers, because the waiters could have been\\nrude to the customers even as they served a record number of breakfasts. Because your\\nbusiness depends on people wanting what you sell, you must be concerned with the\\npublic’s opinion of your service. Perhaps you should set up a “customer complaint log”\\nmaintained by the cashier. If one of your waiters elicited more than the usual number of\\ncomplaints yesterday, you will want to speak to him first thing today.\\nAll these indicators measure factors essential to running your factory. If you look\\nat them early every day, you will often be able to do something to correct a potential\\nproblem before it becomes a real one during the course of the day.\\nIndicators tend to direct your attention toward what they are monitoring. It is like\\nriding a bicycle: you will probably steer it where you are looking. If, for example, you\\nstart measuring your inventory levels carefully, you are likely to take action to drive your\\ninventory levels down, which is good up to a point. But your inventories could become\\nso lean that you can’t react to changes in demand without creating shortages. So because\\nindicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting. This you can do\\nby pairing indicators, so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Thus,\\nin the inventory example, you need to monitor both inventory levels and the incidence\\nof shortages. A rise in the latter will obviously lead you to do things to keep inventories\\nfrom becoming too low.\\nThe principle here was evident many times in the development of a compiler.\\nMeasuring the completion date of each software unit against its capability is one\\nexample. Watching this pair of indicators should help us to avoid working on the\\nperfect compiler that will never be ready, and also to avoid rushing to finish one that\\nis inadequate. In sum, joint monitoring is likely to keep things in the optimum middle\\nNowhere can indicators—and paired indicators—be of more help than in\\nadministrative work. Having come to this realization, our company has been using\\nmeasurements as a key tool to improve the productivity of administrative work for\\nseveral years. The first rule is that a measurement—any measurement—is better than\\nnone. But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the owtput of the work unit and not\\nsimply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets\\n(output), not by the calls he makes (activity).\\nThe second criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a\\nphysical, countable thing. Examples of effective measures of administrative output are\\nshown below. Because those listed here are all quantity or output indicators, their paired\\ncounterparts should stress the quality of work. Thus, in accounts payable, the number\\nof vouchers processed should be paired with the number of errors found either by\\nauditing or by our suppliers. For another example, the number of square feet cleaned by\\nacustodial group should be paired with a partially objective/partially subjective rating of\\nthe quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building.\\nADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION WORK OUTPUT INDICATOR\\nAccounts payable # Vouchers processed\\nCustodial # Square feet cleaned\\nCustomer service # Sales orders entered\\nData entry # Transactions processed\\nEmployment # People hired (by type of hire)\\nInventory control # Items managed in inventory\\nExamples of administrative work output indicators.\\nSuch indicators have many uses. First, they spell out very clearly what the objectives\\nof an individual or group are. Second, they provide a degree of objectivity when\\nmeasuring an administrative function. Third, and as important as any, they give us\\na measure by which various administrative groups performing the same function in\\ndifferent organizations can be compared with each other. The performance of a custodial\\ngroup in one major building can now be compared with that of another group in a\\nsecond building. In fact, if indicators are put in place, the competitive spirit engendered\\nfrequently has an electrifying effect on the motivation each group brings to its work,\\nalong with a parallel improvement in performance. More about this later when we\\nexamine the “sports analogy.”\\nThe Black Box\\nWe can think of our breakfast factory as if it were a “black box”: input (the raw materials)\\nand the labor of waiters, helpers, and you, the manager, flowing into the box, and the\\noutput (the breakfast) flowing out of it as illustrated below. In general, we can represent\\nany activity that resembles a production process in a simple fashion as a black box. Thus,\\nwe can draw a black box to represent college recruiting, where the input is the applicants\\non campus and the output is college graduates who have accepted our employment\\noffers. The labor is the work of our on-campus interviewers and the managers and\\ntechnical people who interview back at the plant. Similarly, the process of field sales\\ntraining can be seen as a black box with the input being the raw product specifications\\nand the output being trained sales personnel, The labor here is the work of the marketing\\nand merchandising people who turn raw information into usable sales tools and train\\nthe field sales personnel to exploit them. In fact, we can represent most, if not all,\\nadministrative work by our magical black box. A group whose job is to bill customers has\\nas its input the information about the customer—what he has purchased, the pricing\\ndata, and the shipment records; and output is the final bill sent to the customer through\\nwhich payment is collected. The labor is the work of all personnel involved.\\nThe breakfast factory—as a “black box.\"\\nThe black box sorts out what the inputs, the output, and the labor are in the\\nproduction process. We can improve our ability to run that process by cutting some\\nwindows in our box so that we can see some of what goes on within it. By looking through\\nthe openings, as illustrated below, we can better understand the internal workings of any\\nproduction process and assess what the future output is likely to be.\\nBy peering through the windows in the black box, we can get an\\nidea of what the future output is likely to be,\\nAnd because they give you time to take\\ncorrective action, they make it possible for you to avoid problems. Of course, for leading\\nindicators to do you any good, you must believe in their validity. While this may seem\\nobvious, in practice, confidence is not as easy to come by as it sounds. To take big, costly,\\nor worrisome steps when you are not yet sure you have a problem is hard. But unless you\\nare prepared to act on what your leading indicators are telling you, all you will get from\\nmonitoring them is anxiety. Thus, the indicators you choose should be credible, so that\\nyou will, in fact, act whenever they flash warning signals.\\nLeading indicators might include the daily monitors we use to run our breakfast\\nfactory, from machine downtime records to an index of customer satisfaction—both of\\nwhich can tell us if problems lie down the road. A generally applicable example of a\\n“window” cut into the black box is the linearity indicator. In the figure below, we provide\\none for the college recruiting process. Plotted here is the number of college graduates\\nwho have accepted our offers versus the month of the year. If all went ideally, we would\\nmove along the straight line that would yield our hiring target for the semester by the\\nmonth of June. If by April the actual progress is as shown here, we will find ourselves far\\nbelow the ideal straight line. So from reading the indicator, we know that the only way\\nwe can hit our target is by getting acceptance at a much higher rate in the remaining two\\nmonths than we had gotten in the preceding four. Thus, the linearity indicator flashes an\\nearly warning, allowing us time to take corrective action Without it, we would discover\\nthat we had missed our target in June, when nothing can be done about it.\\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun\\nThe linearity indicator can give us an early warning thet we are likely to miss our target.\\nIf we consider a manufacturing unit in this fashion, we may assume that because it\\nmakes monthly goals regularly, all is well. But we can cut a window into the black box\\nhere, measure production output against time as the month proceeds, and compare that\\nwith the ideal linear output. We may learn that output performance is spread evenly\\nthroughout the course of the month or that it is concentrated in the last week of the\\nmonth. If the latter is the case, the manager of the unit is probably not using manpower\\nand equipment efficiently. And if the situation is not remedied, one minor breakdown\\ntoward month’s end could cause the unit to miss its monthly output goal entirely.\\nThe linearity indicator will help you anticipate such a problem and is therefore quite\\nAlso valuable are trend indicators. These show output (breakfasts delivered, software\\nmodules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this\\nmonth versus performance over a series of previous months), and also against some\\nstandard or expected level. A display of trends forces you to look at the future as you\\nare led to extrapolate almost automatically from the past. This extrapolation gives us\\nanother window in our black box. Also, measurement against a standard makes you\\nthink through why the results were what they were, and not what the standard said they\\nAnother sound way to anticipate the future is through the use of the stagger chart,\\nwhich forecasts an output over the next several months. The chart is updated monthly,\\nso that each month you will have an updated version of the then-current forecast\\ninformation as compared to several prior forecasts. You can readily see the variation of\\none forecast from the next, which can help you anticipate future trends better than if\\nyou used a simple trend chart.\\nIn my experience, nowhere has the stagger chart been more productive than in\\nforecasting economic trends. The way it works is shown in the figure below, which\\ngives us forecasted rates of incoming orders for an Intel division. The stagger chart then\\nprovides the same forecast prepared in the following month, in the month after that, and\\nso on. Such a chart shows not only your outlook for business month by month but also\\nhow your outlook varied from one month to the next. This way of looking at incoming\\nbusiness, of course, makes whoever does the forecasting take his task very seriously,\\nbecause he knows that his forecast for any given month will be routinely compared\\nwith future forecasts and eventually with the actual result. But even more important,\\nthe improvement or deterioration of the forecasted outlook from one month to the next\\nprovides the most valuable indicator of business trends that I have ever seen. I would go\\nas far as to say that it\\'s too bad that all economists and investment advisers aren\\'t obliged\\nto display their forecasts in a stagger chart form. Then we could really have a way to\\nevaluate whatever any one of them chooses to say.\\nForecasted incomnins orders for:\\n(* means the actual number for that month)\\nIhave found the “stagger chart” the best means of getting a feel for future business trends.\\nFinally, indicators can be a big help in solving all types of problems. If something goes\\nwrong, you will have a bank of information that readily shows all the parameters of your\\noperation, allowing you to scan them for unhealthy departures from the norm. If you do\\nControlling Future Output\\nThere are two ways to control the output of any factory. Some industries build to order.\\nFor example, when you go shopping for a sofa, you are going to have to wait a long time\\nto get what you bought, unless you buy it right off the floor. A furniture factory builds\\nto order. When it learns what you want, the factory looks for a hole in its manufacturing\\nschedule and makes the item for you. If you order a new car rather than buying one right\\noff the lot, the same thing happens: the plant will paint the car in the color you want and\\nprovide the options you want, but you will have to wait for it. And our breakfast factory,\\nof course, builds breakfasts to order.\\nBut if your competition in the sofa business makes the same product but has it ready\\nin four weeks while you need four months, you are not going to have many customers. So\\neven though you would much rather build to order, you will have to use another way to\\ncontrol the output of your factory. In short, you will have to build to forecast, which is a\\ncontemplation of future orders. To do this, the manufacturer sets up his activities around\\na reasoned speculation that orders will materialize for specific products within a certain\\nAn obvious disadvantage here is that the manufacturer takes an inventory risk. Since\\nthe forecast is an assessment of future requirements, which the manufacturer commits\\nresources to satisfy, the factory could be in an immense amount of trouble if the orders\\ndo not materialize or if they materialize for a product other than the one anticipated.\\nIn either case, unwanted inventory is the result. To build to forecast, you risk capital to\\nrespond to anticipated future demand in good order.\\nAt Intel, we build to forecast because our customers demand that we respond to\\ntheir needs in a timely fashion, even though our manufacturing throughput times\\nare quite long. Our breakfast factory makes its product to customer order, but buys\\nfrom its suppliers—like the egg man—on the basis of forecasted demand. Similarly,\\nmost companies recruit new college graduates to fill anticipated needs—rather than\\nrecruiting only when a need develops, which would be foolish because college graduates\\nare turned out in a highly seasonal fashion. Computer software products, such as\\ncompilers, are also typically developed in response to an anticipated market need rather\\nthan to specific customer order. So “building” to forecast is a very common business\\nDelivering a product that was built to forecast to a customer consists of two\\nsimultaneous processes, each with a separate time cycle. A manufacturing flow must\\noccur in which the raw material moves through various production steps and finally\\nenters the finished goods warehouse, as illustrated below. Simultaneously, a salesman\\nfinds a prospect and sells to that prospect, who eventually places an order with the\\nmanufacturer. Ideally, the order for the product and the product itself should arrive on\\nthe shipping dock at the same time.\\nBecause the art and science of forecasting is so complex, you might be tempted to\\ngive all forecasting responsibility to a single manager who can be made accountable\\nfor it. But this usually does not work very well. What works better is to ask both\\nthe manufacturing and the sales departments to prepare a forecast, so that people are\\nresponsible for performing against their own predictions.\\nAt Intel we try to match the two parallel flows with as much precision as possible.\\nIf there’s no match, we end up with a customer order that we can\\'t satisfy or with\\na finished product for which we have no customer. Either way we have problems.\\nObviously, if the match does come off, with a forecasted order becoming a real order, the\\ncustomer’s requirements can be nicely satisfied with the factory\\'s product delivery.\\nThe order for the product and the product itself should arrive\\nat the shipping dock at the same time.\\nThe ideal is rarely found in the real world. More often, customer orders don’t develop\\nin time or the customer changes his mind. As for the other flow, manufacturing\\ncould miss deadlines, or make mistakes, or encounter unforeseen problems. Because\\nneither the sales flow nor the manufacturing flow is completely predictable, we should\\ndeliberately build a reasonable amount of “slack” into the system. And inventory is the\\nmost obvious place for it. Clearly, the more inventory we have, the more change we can\\ncope with and still satisfy orders. But inventory costs money to build and keep, and\\ntherefore should be controlled carefully. Ideally, inventory should be kept at the lowest-\\nvalue stage, as we\\'ve learned before, like raw eggs kept at the breakfast factory. Also, the\\nlower the value, the more production flexibility we obtain for a given inventory cost.\\nIt is a good idea to use stagger charts in both the manufacturing and sales forecasts.\\nAs noted, they will show the trend of change from one forecast to another, as well as the\\nactual results. By repeatedly observing the variance of one forecast from another, you\\nwill continually pin down the causes of inaccuracy and improve your ability to forecast\\nboth orders and the availability of product.\\nForecasting future work demands and then adjusting the output of an\\n“administrative factory” represents a very important way in which its productivity\\ncan be increased. Though an old and honored way of operating “widget factories,”\\nthe application of forecasting techniques is hardly common as a way to control\\nadministrative work. Such work has up to now been considered qualitatively different\\nfrom work in a widget factory, and has also lacked objective performance standards\\nneeded to size or scale the work unit.\\nBut if we have carefully chosen indicators that characterize an administrative unit\\nand watch them closely, we are ready to apply the methods of factory control to\\nadministrative work. We can use de facto standards, inferred from the trend data,\\nto forecast the number of people needed to accomplish various anticipated tasks. By\\nrigorous application of the principles of forecasting, manpower can be reassigned from\\none area to another, and the headcount made to match the forecasted growth or decline\\nin administrative activity. Without rigor, the staffing of administrative units would\\nalways be left at its highest level and, given Parkinson\\'s famous law, people would find\\nways to let whatever they’re doing fill the time available for its completion. There is no\\nquestion that having standards and believing in them and staffing an administrative\\nunit objectively using forecasted workloads will help you to maintain and enhance\\nAs we have said, manufacturing’s charter is to deliver product at a quality level\\nacceptable to the customer at minimum cost. To assure that the quality of our product\\nwill in fact be acceptable, all production flows, whether they “make” breakfasts, college\\ngraduates, or software modules, must possess inspection points. To get acceptable\\nquality at the lowest cost, it is vitally important to reject defective material at a stage\\nwhere its accumulated value is at the lowest possible level. Thus, as noted, we are better\\noff catching a bad raw egg than a cooked one, and screening out our college applicant\\nbefore he visits Intel. In short, reject before investing further value.\\nIn the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect\\nraw material is called incoming material inspection or receiving inspection. If we again use\\na black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening\\npoints within it are called, logically enough, in-process inspections. Finally, the last\\npossible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is\\ncalled final inspection or outgoing quality inspection. The three types are depicted below.\\nValue of Material\\nThe key principle is to reject the defective “material” at its lowest-value stage.\\nWhen material is rejected at incoming inspection, a couple of choices present\\nthemselves. We can send it back to the vendor as unacceptable, or we can waive our\\nspecifications and use the substandard material anyway. The latter would result in a\\nhigher reject rate in our production process than if we had used thoroughly acceptable\\nmaterial, but that might be less expensive than shutting down the factory altogether\\nuntil cur vendor provides better material. Such decisions can only be made properly\\nby a balanced group of managers, which typically consists of representatives from the\\nquality assurance, manufacturing, and design engineering departments. This group can\\nweigh all the consequences of rejecting or accepting substandard raw material.\\nWhile in most instances the decision to accept or reject defective material at a given\\nInspection point is an economic one, one should never let substandard material proceed\\nwhen its defects could cause a complete failure—a reliability problem—for our customer.\\nSimply put, because we can never assess the consequences of an unreliable product, we\\ncan’t make compromises when it comes to reliability. Think of a component going into\\nthe making of a cardiac pacemaker. If some of the components don’t work upon receipt\\nby the manufacturer, he can replace them while the unit is still in the factory. This will\\nprobably increase costs. But if the component fails later, after the pacemaker has been\\nimplanted, the cost of the failure is much more than a financial one.\\nInspections, of course, cost money to perform and further add to expense by\\ninterfering with the manufacturing flow and making it more complicated. Some\\nmaterial has to be recycled through steps already performed, upsetting the smoothness\\nwith which the rest of the material moves. Accordingly, one should approach the need\\nto inspect recognizing that a balance exists between the desired result of the inspection,\\nimproved quality, and minimum disturbance to the production process itself.\\nLet’s consider a few techniques commonly used to balance the two needs. There is a\\ngate-like inspection and a monitoring step. In the former, all material is held at the “gate”\\nuntil the inspection tests are completed. If the material passes, it is moved on to the\\nnext stage in the production process; if the material fails, it will be returned to an earlier\\nstage, where it will be reworked or scrapped. In the latter, a sample of the material is\\ntaken, and if it fails, a notation is made from which a failure rate is calculated. The bulk\\nof the material is not held as the sample is taken but continues to move through the\\nmanufacturing process. The smoothness of the flow is maintained, but if, for example,\\nthree successive samples fail the monitoring test, we can stop the line. What is the\\ntrade-off here? If we hold all the material, we add to throughput time and slow down\\nthe manufacturing process. A monitor produces no comparable slowdown but might let\\nsome bad material escape before we can act on the monitor’s results and shut things\\ndown, which means that we might have to reject material later at a higher-value stage.\\nClearly, for the same money we can do a lot more monitoring than gate-type inspections;\\nif we do the former, we may well contribute more to the overall quality of the product\\nthan if we choose less frequent gate-like inspections. The trade-off here is not obvious,\\nand any choice has to be made with a specific case in mind. As a rule of thumb, we\\nshould lean toward monitoring when experience shows we are not likely to encounter\\nAnother way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use variable inspections.\\nBecause quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we\\ninspect. For instance, if for weeks we don\\'t find problems, it would seem logical to check\\nless often. But if problems begin to develop, we can test ever more frequently until\\nquality again returns to the previous high levels. The advantage here is still lower costs\\nand even less interference with the production flow. Yet this approach is not used very\\noften, even in widget manufacturing. Why not? Probably because we are creatures of\\nhabit and keep doing things the way we always have, whether it be from week to week or\\nyear to year.\\nSuitably thought through, intelligent inspection schemes can actually increase the\\nefficiency and productivity of any manufacturing or administrative process. Let’s take\\nan example very different from the making of widgets or breakfasts.\\nI recently read a story in a news magazine that said that the American Embassy in\\nLondon could not deal with a deluge of visa applications. Some one million Britons apply\\nfor visas each year, of which about 98 percent are approved. The embassy employs sixty\\npeople, who process as many as 6,000 applications a day. Most applications are received\\nby mail, and at any time, from 60,000 to 80,000 British passports are in the embassy’s\\nhands. Meanwhile, lines of one hundred or more British and other nationals stand\\nin front of the building, looking for an opportunity to walk their passports through.\\nThe embassy has tried a number of ways to handle matters more efficiently, including\\nnewspaper advertisements asking tourists to apply early and to expect a three-week\\nturnaround. The embassy also installed boxes where applicants could drop off their\\npassports and visa applications if they really needed same-day service. Even so, the lines\\nat the embassy remained long.\\nIn fact, the embassy’s expediting schemes only made the problem worse, because\\nnothing was done to address the basic issue: to speed the processing of visas overall.\\nTime and money were spent to classify various kinds of applications slated for different\\nprocessing times, but this only created more logistical overhead with no effect on\\nIf our government wants British tourists to visit the United States, our government\\nshould not irritate these would-be visitors. And if the embassy can’t get the money to\\nincrease its staff, a simple solution can be borrowed from basic production techniques.\\nWe need, in short, to replace their present scheme with a quality assurance test.\\nFor that, the bureaucratic minds at the embassy would need to accept that a 100\\npercent check of the visa applicants is unnecessary. Some 98 percent of those applying\\nare approved without any question. So if the embassy were to institute a sampling test\\nof visas (a quality assurance test), and a thorough one at that, the logjam of applications\\ncould be broken without materially increasing the chance that the undesirable will enter\\nour country. Moreover, the embassy could select the sample to be checked according\\nto predetermined criteria. The visa processing could then work rather like the Internal\\nRevenue Service. Through the checks and audits that the IRS performs, that government\\nagency induces compliance among most taxpayers without having an agent look at\\nevery single return.\\nLater, when we examine managerial productivity, we\\'ll see that when a manager\\ndigs deeply into a specific activity under his jurisdiction, he’s applying the principle of\\nvariable inspection. If the manager examined everything his various subordinates did,\\nhe would be meddling, which for the most part would be a waste of his time. Even worse,\\nhis subordinates would become accustomed to not being responsible for their own work,\\nknowing full well that their supervisor will check everything out closely. The principle\\nof variable inspection applied to managerial work nicely skirts both problems, and, as we\\nshall see, gives us an important tool for improving managerial productivity.\\nThe workings of our black box can furnish us with the simplest and most useful\\ndefinition of productivity. The productivity of any function occurring within it is the\\noutput divided by the labor required to generate the output. Thus, one way to increase\\nproductivity is to do whatever we are now doing, but faster. This could be done by\\nreorganizing the work area or just by working harder. Here we\\'ve not changed what work\\nwe do, we\\'ve just instituted ways to do it faster—getting more activities per employee-\\nhour to go on inside the black box. Because the output of the black box is proportional to\\nthe activity that occurs within it, we will get more output per hour.\\nThere is a second way to improve productivity. We can change the nature of the work\\nperformed: what we do, not how fast we do it. We want to increase the ratio of output\\nto activity, thereby increasing output even if the activity per employee-hour remains the\\nsame. As the slogan has it, we want to “work smarter, not harder.”\\nProductivity can be increased by performing the work activities at a higher rate...\\n..or by increasing the leverage of the activities,\\nHere Id like to introduce the concept of leverage, which is the output generated by a\\nspecific type of work activity. An activity with high leverage will generate a high level\\nof output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output. For example, a waiter\\nable to boil two eggs and operate two toasters can deliver two breakfasts for almost the\\nsame amount of work as one. His output per activity, and therefore his leverage, is high.\\nA waiter who can handle only one egg and one toaster at a time possesses lower output\\nand leverage. The software engineer using a programming language rather like English,\\nlater to be translated by a compiler, can solve many problems per hour of programming.\\nHis output and leverage are high. A software engineer using a more cumbersome\\nprogramming method of ones and zeros will require many more hours to solve the same\\nnumber of problems. His output and leverage are low. Thus, a very important way to\\nincrease productivity is to arrange the work flow inside our black box so that it will be\\ncharacterized by high output per activity, which is to say high-leverage activities.\\nAutomation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work.\\nHaving machines to help them, human beings can create more output. But in both\\nwidget manufacturing and administrative work, something else can also increase the\\nproductivity of the black box. This is called work simplification. To get leverage this way,\\nyou first need to create a flow chart of the production process as it exists. Every single\\nstep must be shown on it; no step should be omitted in order to pretty things up on\\npaper. Second, count the number of steps in the flow chart so that you know how many\\nyou started with. Third, set a rough target for reduction of the number of steps. In the\\nfirst round of work simplification, our experience shows that you can reasonably expect\\na 30 to 50 percent reduction.\\nTo implement the actual simplification, you must question why each step is\\nperformed. Typically, you will find that many steps exist in your work flow for no good\\nreason. Often they are there by tradition or because formal procedure ordains it, and\\nnothing practical requires their inclusion. Remember, the “visa factory” at our embassy\\nin Britain didn’t really have to process 100 percent of the applicants. So no matter\\nwhat reason may be given for a step, you must critically question each and throw out\\nthose that common sense says you can do without. We found that in a wide range\\nof administrative activities at Intel, substantial reduction—about 30 percent—could be\\nachieved in the number of steps required to perform various tasks.\\nOf course, the principle of work simplification is hardly new in the widget\\nmanufacturing arts. In fact, this is one of the things industrial engineers have been\\ndoing for a hundred years. But the application of the principle to improve the\\nproductivity of the “soft professions”—the administrative, professional, and managerial\\nworkplace—is new and slow to take hold. The major problem to be overcome is defining\\nwhat the output of such work is or should be. As we will see, in the work of the soft\\nprofessions, it becomes very difficult to distinguish between output and activity.
