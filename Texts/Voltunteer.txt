Opportunities

A Partner Guide for Custom Reservations
Are you a company, school, or faith-based group interested in volunteering with a nonprofit on Golden? With Golden's Custom Reservation feature, you can reserve spots for public volunteer opportunities, and manage volunteers from your group with ease. After reaching out to the nonprofit and requesting a reservation, follow these simple steps for getting your group reservation set up! 

Step 1: Claim Your Invitation
Once you have confirmed the opportunity, timeslot, and number of volunteers you would live to bring with the organizer, you should receive an email confirming that a Custom Reservation has been made for your group. 

In this email, you can Manage Your Group, as well as manage other reservations you have made with the organization. By clicking the Manage Reservations tab, you will be brought to a page where you can monitor the opportunities your group has participated in the past, and monitor volunteer activities among your group. 

2. Managing Your Reservation
If you click on the Manage Group button, you will be brought to a page that allows you to manage the Custom Reservation that was made for your group. In this window, you can cancel guest reservations, message your team, and fill incomplete reservations through generating a link that you can share with your colleagues, classmates, or friends. You will also get access into the Event Opportunity, Time Slot, Organizer, and Opportunity Manager. 

3. Completing Registrations
You can add participants from your team to a Custom Reservation in several ways. 

Option 1: Sending a Share Link

When you click on the Manage Group button in your email, you can generate a share link that you can send to your colleagues. By clicking on the share link, you will be brought to a page where you can register for the opportunity. 

Option 2: Send the Organizer a Spreadsheet
You can send the organizer of the event a copy of volunteers you'd like to register for this opportunity. When creating your spreadsheet, please generate 3 separate columns: first name, last name, and email of the volunteers from your group you are registering.  

How do I sign up for an Opportunity?

iOS Mobile App
Signing up for Opportunities is easier than ever with tons of local events at your fingertips. Login to the Golden Android App, and select Discover (compass symbol) from the bottom navigation. Scroll to find an Opportunity that looks appealing to you, and click on it to get more details. Some Opportunities may require prerequisite screenings, such as Parental Consent, Background Checks, or an Emergency Contact. Otherwise, all you have to do is hit "Down to Volunteer" and be on your way.

Some Opportunities may require prerequisite screenings, such as Parental Consent, Background Checks, or an Emergency Contact. Otherwise, all you have to do is hit "Down to Volunteer" and be on your way:

Once you sign up, you will be able to view the address, add it to your calendar, and share it with your friends and family! If you wish to sign friends up or bring kids along, please access the Golden Web Portal. 

Web Portal
Signing up for Opportunities on the web portal is a piece of cake! Locate the Opportunity you would like to attend, and hit sign up on the right hand site of the screen. As well, you can bring along any friends or children as you wish. You can sign up as many additional people you would like, and you will be responsible for their attendance. 

Please note, after signing up, you may be required to complete any prerequisite screenings as necessary. For instance, this Opportunity requires Parental/ Guardian consent if you are under the age of 18 years old. If so, you will not be signed up and allowed to see the address until you have your parent's permission. Some Opportunities may require background checks, which must be completed through the Golden App. 

How do I Share an Opportunity?

Mobile App
In order to Share an Opportunity, click the small icon  0-2.jpg in the upper right hand corner of any Opportunity to quickly send it to friends and family! You can send it via text message, e-mail, social media, or copy and paste it anywhere else you choose! This is a great way to let everyone know to join you for a fun day of volunteering. 

Web Portal
In order to share an Opportunity, please copy and paste the link provided under the sign up section. Every Opportunity created, automatically comes with Share links that you can send to your friends and family! You can copy and paste these Share links everywhere. We recommend you post these on your social media, facebook etc. to let everyone know to join you!

How do I cancel/unenroll for an opportunity I signed up for?

Cancelling a signup can be done on a mobile device or on a computer.
In the app, your opportunities can be viewed on the main page. Select the opportunity and choose "Cancel Reservation" at the bottom of the page.
If you'd like to cancel a signup on a computer, make sure you are logged into your Golden account, and select your name in the top right-hand corner. Select "my opportunities" and then select "cancel" for the specific opportunity you would like to unregister for.

Can I register guests to come with me?

Most Golden Opportunities allow Volunteers to add "+1's" that might include children, friends, or other kinds of guests during the signup process. To add a guest, you will add them before you click the Sign Up button! 
Simply select the options shown in the below screenshots and add their information to reserve a spot for guests (note that some Opportunities do not allow +1's, so that option may not be available). Note that when adding a guest, emails are optional. If your guest has participated in an Opportunity through Golden, then the same email they used before should be what is used here. If you do not include an email, then the guests' emails will go to your email address.
Once you click the "Bring a Friend or Child" option, you will see this menu open so that you can enter the guest details. You don't need to enter your own details here, that will be input once you finish and then click the Orange Sign Up button. 

How do volunteers report hours completed in their own time?

You can report hours completed in your own time when an organizer creates a Virtual Opportunity with no time slots. This Opportunity will always live in "My Golden Opportunities" and it is a great way to make sure you get credit for all of your hard work! 
You can log past time in the Golden App or in the portal website

How do I filter through Opportunities?
Filtering through opportunities on the mobile app is quick and easy. On the Discover tab, tap the the slider icon in the top right hand corner and select your preferences. You can change your opportunity feed by selecting time, location, as well as the type of volunteer experience!

What is a Footprint and why am I asked to report it?
Golden allows organizations to track key program data like how many hours you volunteered with them. But we can even go beyond that and track the impact that you had for them.

Footprint = Impact
Sometimes, your volunteer contribution might be best measured by looking at the total output of your work. That could be...

Pounds of trash that you picked up
Miles of trail that you cleared
Number of diapers that you are donating
and much more! 
When creating Opportunities, organizers may or may not set a "Footprint" that they want to track. If they do, you will automatically be prompted to enter your Footprint after the Opportunity has finished.

You can enter your Footprint in...

The mobile apps
The volunteer web portal
For ongoing Opportunities too!
 
In the Mobile Apps
Users in the iPhone or Android apps will automatically be prompted to leave a Reflection after the opportunity ends.

Usually, a Reflection is a chance to evaluate your experience at a volunteer opportunity and leave comments to the organizers, but it's also the place you can leave your Footprint! 
 
In the Volunteer Web Portal
You can also use the volunteer portal website to report your Footprint!

Just navigate to the "My Opportunities" menu at the top right of the screen and view your Completed Opportunities to report your Footprint. 
See the image below for a visualization of logging hours for an ongoing opportunity on our portal website: 
 
Participating in an ongoing Opportunity?
For ongoing opportunities (AKA opportunities for which you log your own hours) you can log your Footprint metric at the bottom of the mobile app (or in the volunteer web portal!) when logging your hours.

Mutual Aid Volunteering: The Basics
4 years ago Updated
Not yet followed by anyone
As of March 20, 2020

In response to the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic and the significant risk it poses to vulnerable members of every community, we are pre-releasing a website where you can safely serve your neighbors and get help you need, online and in person, available immediately at: https://mutualaid.goldenvolunteer.com/

Therefore, please note that these features are a beta product. Use them at your own risk, but please consider using them to provide aid in this time of need. All standard Mutual Aid products are COMPLETELY FREE.

Be aware of safety and hygiene - both your own and that of the people with whom you will interact. Be aware that Mutual Aid Opportunities may take place in or around private residences or residential neighborhoods. 

 

You Can Help:
Free Platform for High-Priority Volunteering during COVID-19

The concept of "Mutual Aid" is a movement of neighbors helping each other with basic tasks that individuals cannot perform on their own, but enable them to live at a much higher standard. During COVID-19, this can mean delivering meals, checking on others, and performing everyday tasks virtually and in-person.

Golden has been developing the Mutual Aid support website based on research with Not Impossible Labs and Advent Health to deliver out-of-home care to discharged hospital patients. 

We hope that this free, easy-to-use, purpose-built site enables organizers to get help to those who need it most faster and more effectively than the email and chat lists we've seen emerge in the last few days. You can find further background in a Medium post.

 

What is Available Right Now:
If you're an organizer or manage a community of needs, we have additional tools for you.

At mutualaid.goldenvolunteer.com, anyone can:

List a need 


Sign up to fulfill a need 


"Mutual Aid" needs (or Opportunities) are Volunteer Opportunities created by or on behalf of individuals who are in need of help. These could include:

A homebound person recovering from surgery needs help with a basic household task
Patient care providers helping discharged patients receive care from volunteers at home
A child who lives far away asking, on behalf of an elderly parent, for help taking out their trash
Religious leaders directing members of their congregations to support others directly
And any number of things you can think of...
Note: if you already have Golden account credentials, you can use the same login on the Mutual Aid site.

 

A Mutual Aid opportunity listing can be shared with a link in any social media platform, SMS or email. Like standard Golden Volunteer Opportunities, it includes automatic participation tracking, captures digital waiver signatures, and is GDPR, COPPA, and CCPA compliant.
 

Golden will be continuously adding safety features, such as live background checking of organizers and participants, in the coming hours and days.

 

If You Manage a Community...
...or have created a email list or signup form or any other wonderful form of organizing people to help, we have additional FREE tools for you.

If you are a new Dashboard user, contact us at support@goldenvolunteer.com to get set up.

If you have an existing Dashboard account on Golden and want to create Mutual Aid Opportunities from the Dashboard, go to  https://dashboard2.goldenvolunteer.com/ and use your same Dashboard credentials. However, please contact support@goldenvolunteer.com so that we can turn on the right features.


You'll notice...

A new interface with fun new visuals.
The UX is not perfect, but the basic functions work.
Accessing Participant/Volunteer information is a bit jumbled - don't worry, we are providing full contact info in the confirmation and sign-up notification emails.
The Participants and Settings sections don't work very well (remember, this is a beta product!); we encourage you to ignore these sections.
You can create and manage Local Opportunities, but we encourage you to manage these in the original Dashboard.
Note: you can access Mutual Aid Opportunities in the original Dashboard, but we encourage you to only manage them in Dashboard 2.
 

Frequently Asked Questions:
I wasn't able to complete an Opportunity I signed up for. What do I do?

The confirmation and reminder emails you were sent have contact information for the Host and Organizer. Please contact them immediately!
How do I know if the Volunteer completed the Opportunity that I created on behalf of someone else?

The sign-up notification email and the Reminder Email sent to you have contact info for the Volunteer. Please call them directly.

How do I know if a Mutual Aid opp is safe?

We will be continuously adding safety features, such as live background checking of organizers and participants, in the coming hours and days. In the meantime, we have provided volunteers with contact info for the Hosts and Organizers and vice versa in all the confirmation emails. Please use those to communicate freely.

I'm a Volunteer - how do I cancel my registration for a Mutual Aid Opportunity?

There is a cancellation link in the Confirmation Email that you received upon sign up. You can also cancel from your profile on mutualaid.goldenvolunteer.com. If you have not yet set up a profile, go to https://mutualaid.goldenvolunteer.com/account/forgot to set up (it will say "Reset" but this acts in the same way) your password.
I listed a need directly from mutualaid.goldenvolunteer.com - how do I cancel that?

Go to https://mutualaid.goldenvolunteer.com/registrations/filter/active and cancel the Need/Opportunity in question.

Screen_Shot_2020-03-20_at_11.58.22_AM.png

No one has signed up for the Mutual Aid Need/Opportunity that I created - what do I do? 

First, we'll send you an email 8 hours ahead of the start time of your Opportunity if no one has signed up yet. Second, we encourage you to Share the listing via your own networks - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, text, WhatsApp - to make sure it reaches as many people as possible. Third, if you created this on behalf of someone else, please communicate with them so that they are aware that there is not currently someone available to do this. Here at Golden, we are working hard to get as much exposure for your listings as possible, but we cannot guarantee that all needs will be fulfilled.
